Therefore, FPT Education offers students an interesting, diverse learning system, extremely useful, via multiple active activities.

**Understanding the experiential learning**

Following a FPT student in a year, it is not difficult to realize that the duration of hands-on learning lessons is well-invested as much as theoretical lessons which apparently goes against the commonly-seen teaching method of traditional school. This aims to enhance the integration between theoretical knowledge and practical skills for students during their study experience in FPT Education. 

Particularly, these activities are cleverly integrated into curriculum programs and extracurricular activities. Thus, students will be interested in learning, mastering the knowledge, skills, and not just passively learning to pass exams. 

&#x200B;

[One of the most interesting activities in Hola techday](https://preview.redd.it/zxl50kwan2o91.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bf910941d342c636b9f14bed5e90298fd95df63f)

School experience not only does students acquire suitable knowledge but also equip more practical skills in the working environment, even when they are studying in school.

**Developing diverse skills**

The experiential learning activities in school are designed based on six main experiences: 4.0 technology experience, activities and courses about the 21st century, Vietnamese and East Asian culture experiences, leadership activities, social and future cultural experiences, and world's multicultural experiences.

With diverse activities, students will be provided necessary and helpful skills not only for their studies but also for their lives. Therefore, they can define themselves and create their very own future.

The biggest gap between the school-of-experience model and  traditional-school model is that students can easily approach academic knowledge to improve their multi-skills because of technology in modern life.

**Equality and independence**

With the philosophy of education “Education and training are to organize and manage self-study"", FPT Education always focuses on building an equal and independent school environment. Especially, they are equal in the environment, and independent in study and life.

At FPT Education, students are always encouraged to show their opinion. Even if they are distinct from the majority, students can freely give ideas in contrast to their teachers and involve themselves in discussions to protect their viewpoints. This element is created by a culture of respecting the differences in FPT Education - which is difficult to find in other teaching environments. 

In addition, FPT Education’s lecturers always believe in and allow their students to master their studies and their lives. Without rules, they have a chance to develop themselves in their own ways. Without homework, they freely choose their favorite extracurricular activities on weekends. Moreover, all subjects are equal and respective, students are based on comprehensive evaluations instead of one-sided opinions.

FPT Education brings diverse and helpful knowledge which helps students to have a good grasp of life skills to adapt to the working environment. That is the reason why more and more parents are keen on choosing a practical learning environment as FPT Education for their children's intellectual cradle. 

The best part is this model is not only meant for domestic students since FPT Education is a global studying environment. [FPT Education](https://fpt.edu.vn/) opens opportunities for both local and international students to gain an international learning environment experience through international cooperation programs in higher education such as exchange programs, transfer programs and degree programs at [FPT University](https://international.fpt.edu.vn/fpt-university), [University of Greenwich (Vietnam) ](https://international.fpt.edu.vn/university-of-greenwich-vietnam)and [Swinburne University of Technology (Vietnam)](https://international.fpt.edu.vn/swinburne-university-of-technology-vietnam)."

**There are types of dozer and blades used in construction. The term “dozer” was first used in the nineteenth century to describe an operational mechanism attached to the front of track-type tractors. It was employed to scatter loose dirt out over the top of the overfill. It has evolved through time and is now utilized all around the world to conduct more difficult building operations.**

**Do you know how Dozers have evolved?**

**The dozer was originally referred to as a steel plate and an operational mechanism mounted on the front of track-type tractors. They were affixed to the front end of a pole drawn by horses or oxen and were made of wood. Their major job was to move loose dirt out as it gathered in the overfill. With the passage of time, a dozer blade was added to the machine’s front end, which was controlled by a rope windlass attached to the tractor’s mainframe. Manufacturers began developing dozer blades that matched specifications and quality criteria in the mid-1940s. Both cable and hydraulically controlled versions were available. These track-type tractors were rapidly dubbed “dozers” and were employed for a variety of projects such as motorways, dams, canals, and so on. For material lifting, cable controls were initially used. Dozers eventually gained an onboard computer that allowed the operator to control the** [**blade and produce a specified**](https://www.rbauction.com.au/) **design. Modern dozers are employed for activities like moving material and finishing grading, and they’ve evolved over time. A dozer is available in three sizes: small, medium, and giant. There are now a variety of undercarriage, drivetrain, and blade configurations, as well as a slew of other options. The name “dozer” now refers to tough machinery designed for harsher building jobs.**

**In modern Indian construction, different types of dozers and blades are employed.**

**India plans to spend up to 111 trillion rupees on infrastructure projects over the next four years, thanks to the large investment. Bulldozers are now widely used on roads, trains, and airports as a result of this. Bulldozer producers are now concentrating their efforts on technological advancements that will support the machine’s compact variations and features that will improve its performance on difficult terrains. Built-in intelligence is now available, allowing you to seamlessly integrate with leading GPS grade control systems. They are also available in a variety of power and handling configurations. In India, various types of dozers are employed in road, mining, railway, and** [**other construction projects**](https://buyyourequipment.com/)**.**

**Dozers come in a variety of shapes and sizes.**

**Crawler Dozers**

**The crawler is a tracked dozer with a tractor-like appearance. This l**[**arge equipment is used to transport** ](https://buyyourequipment.com/)**items from one location to another. A Hydrostatic Transmission System is standard on modern crawler dozers, allowing for variable or intermediate speed choices. The mainframe, which is made up of a track frame and connecting bars, was created using modern Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) technology. Dual-path closed-circuits with two variable displacement piston pumps and two 3-speed variable displacement travel motors are standard on contemporary models. For protection against rocks and stumps and to improve longevity, travel motors and final drives are installed inside the track shoe. The use of large-size links, pins, bushings, and special dust seals considerably extends the life and reliability of the undercarriage. Dynamic brakes are used on dozers to guarantee that they operate safely. Light operating effort and good blade response are provided by the 3-axis PPC valve and ergonomically built joystick. All directional movements are controlled using a PCCS (Palm Command Control System) joystick. The blade is easily visible because of the engine hood and well-placed operator seat. This improved blade visibility improves grading efficiency and eliminates operator guesswork. The models are made to maximize the curvature of the blades. Because of the broad blade radius, the material’s rolling-up performance can be enhanced by using the entire blade. This allows for high production while still retaining grading capabilities.**

**Dozers on Wheels**

**This machine, which is also known as a tire dozer, is often larger than a crawler. Wheel dozers have sturdy frames that may last for many years and resist the harshest environments. It has a full box-section rear frame that can withstand torsional and twisting pressures. The installation of the axles has been adjusted to improve structural integrity. The Steering and Transmission Integrated Control System combines directional selection, gear selection, and steering into a single lever on the new models. Powershift transmission is consistent thanks to the Advanced Productivity Electronic Control System’s integrated electronic controls. Fuel-saving features include a mechanically operated electronic unit-injection system, engine-idle-shutdown and engine-idle kick-down systems, delayed-engine-shutdown system, and on-demand and hydraulically powered cooling fan on the latest wheel dozers. Automatic temperature control, touch-screen display with soft keypad, electro/hydraulic parking brake, and the Comfort III seat with air-ride suspension and inbuilt controls are all available in the operator cab.**

**Miniature bulldozers**

**A tiny dozer, sometimes known as a mini dozer, is used for activities that demand more mobility and flexibility than larger equipment. Technology advancements and a new low-emission, fuel-efficient engine are among the features of today’s tiny dozers. It has a redesigned lower sloping hood line that increases finish grade efficiency by improving vision to the periphery view and the blade’s cutting edge. The models had blade capacities ranging from 1.85 to 1.98 cubic metres, 92 horsepower, and operational weights ranging from 8,319 to 8,627 kg. These machines’ Eco mode allows the engine to automatically offer maximum speed and power until the load lowers. A 25-cm primary display with color touchscreen and access to many of the standard and optional advanced technology features is also included in the new model. By supplying the chassis in the cross-slope direction, the slope Assist feature in compact dozers enhances operator efficiency when operating on slopes. This also works in tandem with the operator’s blade control input, making it easier, faster, and with less effort to complete the grade.**

**Dozers that are hybrids**

**These dozers feature electrical components and have a blade combination that can work in both soggy and difficult terrains. The current generation of hybrid dozers excels in load responsiveness, maximum torque, power, and fuel efficiency. The turbocharged engine with an Air-to-Air intercooler uses well-proven multi-injection technology to improve torque back-up and fuel efficiency while lowering engine noise and vibrations. The common rail FPT Industrial engine’s hydrostatic transmission provides best-in-class pulling capacity and controllability. The radiators in the new models are positioned without overlap, allowing each radiator to get fresh air and maintain stable fluid temperatures. The hydrostatic fan adjusts its speed in real time to match the actual cooling need, lowering power consumption. The reverse mode decreases the amount of maintenance required and extends the time between cleanings. For great machine controllability and faster cycle times, the driver can modify all of the working parameters. The cab controls provide a variety of electronic settings and automatic tasks to assist the driver.**

**Dozer Blades of Various Types**

**The blades used in the aforementioned dozer types can be further categorised. Varied blades have different functions, can handle various materials, and can bear a variety of load weights.**

* **Straight Blades (S-Blade) –** **This is the smallest blade dozer with no surface wings; it is assigned to the module’s bottom rear corners. In the bottom back corners of the blade, this blade connects to the arm.**
* **U-Blade (Universal Blade) —** **This blade has lengthy edges and a curved design, making it suitable for transferring material to longer parts. It’s useful for transporting commodities across vast distances. It’s the tallest and widest blade kind, and it works well with mild to medium-density soil.**
* **S-U (SEMI-U) Blade —** **This blade combines the S-blade with the U-blade to offer adequate penetration. It’s perfect for moving soil over great distances.**
* **Angle Blade – This blade is mounted to the bulldozer’s panel in the middle. Because it can tilt close to 30 degrees left or right, it’s for shifting garbage to the side.**
* **Power-Angle-Tilt (PAT) Blade —** **This blade can tilt at any angle in practically all directions and can be controlled from the cabin. Scraping, land clearing, leveling, backfilling, and grading are all tasks that it is employed for.**

**Conclusion**

**The many varieties of dozers and the characteristics provided by manufacturers to propel the need for multi-terrain in India are described above. In order to improve the quality of the work, the construction sector has a high rate of adoption of technologically advanced equipment. Significant investment in rail infrastructure, highway building, and metro rail projects, as well as government housing programs, are expected to drive demand for dozers in India.**"

These days all conversations are revolving around the term Metaverse.

And like most recent innovations, it’s become a buzzword. 

Let’s agree that talking about the idea of a virtual world makes a person look smart. 

Remember the movie matrix? Well, most conversations end there.

But to take this conversation further and apart from the mainstream discussion let’s dive in a little deeper to understand what the main proposition is.  

Coined by the author [Neal Stephenson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/545.Neal_Stephenson) – the term Metaverse was used in his 1992 science fiction novel “Snow Crash”.

I haven’t read the book, but from what I’ve researched Neal had beautifully put words together to depict a scene of a virtual universe with 3D buildings, virtual environments, used lifelike avatars as the characters and built a story around this.  

And let me take this opportunity to add, everything predicted or depicted about the future eventually becomes our unusual reality. 

I mean let’s not go too far, but remember how the movie [Contagion](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778/) predicted the advent of Covid-19? 

I’ll leave this conversation here for now. 

Back to Metaverse, [Facebook](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/) caused quite a stir when it changed its name to Meta and launched a rather unimpressive [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvufun6xer8) where Mark Zuckerberg attempts to demonstrate what Metaverse will appear like. 

And now we have Microsoft staking claims. 

But what is this Metaverse everyone’s so hyped about? And when will we get to experience it?

&#x200B;

## What is the Metaverse?

Simply put it’s the “new age of communication”. 

A product of multiple elements of innovative technology, like virtual reality, mixed reality, and augmented reality. 

These technologies create a digital universe for humans to connect, interact and engage with friends, family, colleagues, clients, etc. 

Some of the commonly used examples can be virtually attending concerts, meetings, conferences and even taking virtual trips across the world.

And we’re not bizarre to think that this is just a far-fetched thought. 

The internet of today serves as the main entry point for billions globally, providing them with valuable information and services. 

It allows us to communicate through hundreds if not thousands of channels, enables instant and effective socializing opportunities, and provides us with unlimited self-entertainment venues. 

So much so that it acts as the single most powerful medium to start and even scale businesses. This means users are able to build, trade, and invest in products, goods, and services.

But as soon as we bring up virtual spaces and ecosystems, things will take an unusual turn.  

In the virtual world, transactions may solely rely on digital currency ([crypto](https://www.sknexus.com/future-of-dogecoin/)) and traded items may be in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) making them a foundation for value creation.

NFTs value proposition could help accelerate the use of XR ecosystems, as places people go to combine elements of the digital economy with their offline lives.

Keeping all this in mind, Metaverse will enhance this experience on a scale that might make it harder for us when distinguishing between being offline and online. 

## Struggle for VR Dominance: Meta Vs Microsoft

## Meta (Previously Facebook, Formerly The Facebook)

There is no denying that this tech giant had already made news of venturing into the world of virtual reality when it acquired Oculus in 2014. 

And since then it hasn’t stopped the hustle. 

In 2018 TechCrunch reported that Meta’s [patent application](http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0&docid=20170235143&IDKey=2E56872310AB&HomeUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fappft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPG01%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D20170235143.PGNR.%2526OS%3D%2526RS%3D) for AR glasses was discovered by reporters at [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-smart-glasses-ar-oculus-patent-2017-8) – these glasses used a  “waveguide display with two-dimensional scanner” as a way to display media onto the lenses. 

So it’s clear that from the very start Zuckerberg has his eyes and mind on something bigger than just a social media site. 

Many believe like his earlier stunts, this too would become the next big thing because the young founder is famous for his “Complete Dominance” claims at the company’s internal meetings. 

But contrary to the popular belief Meta has also seen its fair share of failures. From its unsuccessful quest to buy Snapchat to internal venture failures.   

[Meta](https://about.facebook.com/meta/) is regarded as an industry leader when it comes to social software but not many have heard of its failures such as Building 8, which was envisioned as a support enterprise while venturing into the hardware world.  

Building 8 as many wouldn’t know was Facebook’s first move toward getting into the hardware game. 

Hardware development is tough and especially tough to turn into a business success given the various stakeholders in the game.

Building 8 was turned into Portal in 2018 after it miserably failed after just two and a half years of its inception. 

The only product that was launched under its umbrella was a video-calling device, which neither gained any traction nor was able to survive in a highly competitive market.

After several revamps the device still exists and offers a number of features including enabling users to use Messenger rooms, for large-scale calls of up to 50 people.

Why did I mention this? 

Because Zuckerberg has constantly been working to transition all existing products and domains into the VR and AR spectrum. 

Like in 2018 the Messenger platform enabled businesses to incorporate augmented reality into their Messenger experiences by leveraging the camera effects platform. 

A step closer to his dream of bringing the virtual and physical worlds together – in this case enhancing the online shopping experience by embedding branded AR camera effects into a business’ bot.

To your surprise brands like [Sephora](https://m.me/sephora?ref=fbb_blog), [Nike](https://m.me/NikeSNKRS?ref=fbb_blog), [ASUS](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fm.me%2FASUS%3Fref%3Dfbb_blog&h=AT0pPlkQyqwTuRVJatBA1YkdWcwM-G27P-ojEXKrt0ZMsltxmNarSaEQDw75vaDIQ6c8_K3RXHKdRn8sfxWt42I6caAml6TyZYiqbSm_na0NGW0aFptB1W3BOD2gM8Ect_gOfnkfmkuWaZEkz-3IBg) and [KIA](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fm.me%2Fkia%3Fref%3D%7B%2522localResponse%2522%3A%7B%2522result%2522%3A%7B%2522action%2522%3A%2522ar_-_ad%2522%7D%7D%7D&h=AT2pgVMyRL0rGSQCIbMtF60Vq-fVJCetrX0bGFPnLF0S2UfuSY4ZUINWODSKBoNv_Ty9zeDCIvA8rR_Q5J9a70l82zsBstIILitnXGh5Iqo4aPr8VXrSsdP43k0z8NMfqn8G8sepSqHjk1WbhZxoLg) joined the movement and were present during the launch. 

All these initiatives are a way for Meta to become a step closer to bringing about a virtual world where users can connect and engage for work, entertainment, education and travel using VR headsets.

 A place where digital avatars will exist instead of humans making the internet- in the words of the man himself;  “A more immersive and embodied internet”.  

Now let’s shift to the next giant – Microsoft. 

## Microsoft (formerly also Microsoft)  

[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-pk) made headlines when it unveiled its plans concerning the future of Metaverse soon after Facebook changed its name to Meta.

GORE 2004 MOD RELEASE!,2022-11-28 01:29:30,"Yes, it's finally here. For some background, I've had Code 1 for this mod, and parts of Code 2, since SEPTEMBER 2021! It's been a LONG TIME, and this mod has haunted my dreams for a while, and it's finally out. Before I get to the mod codes, though, I want to thank the many people who helped me along the way:  


First, I want to thank the TCT Discord, because, without their motivation, I couldn't have gotten it out today or likely even this year. I know I kept delaying it(my infamous ""July 23rd"" quote proves it), but I'm proud of the mod that was made.

I want to thank the 4 writers who wrote most of the mod, and without them, this wouldn't have happened at all. They're credited in the mod's description, and I heavily recommend them for any other modding project.

I want to thank the person who randomly sent me an awesome Gore 2004 banner because they were excited about the mod(that's u/thecupojo3**).**

I want to thank my playtesters because I had this feeling that it was going to be awful and rushed, but I got some great and helpful feedback that saved my mental health last night.   


  
NOW FOR THE MOD:  


This is an alternate universe, where the 5-4 Bush v Gore decision went the other way. The Supreme Court ordered a recount to take place, it was decided it would be a statewide recount, and the results barely put Gore over the top. Much bitterness still resides in the Republican party over this defeat. 

Gore's term saw the 9/11 Attacks, which lead to a War with Afghanistan, the Patient Bill Of Rights, stronger environmental protections passed via executive order, and an expansion of educational resources across America. However, Vice President Joe Lieberman has been very unhappy with the conduct of the war...

Going into 2004, the economy is doing fairly well, and Gore is generally approved of. However, the 2004 election begins with a narrow favor towards the Republican... Senator John McCain of Arizona.

After a tight primary race against Governor Mike Huckabee, McCain won the nomination and is faced with the task of uniting a party that hasn't held the White House in 12 years to take it back.

89,https://www.reddit.com/r/eFootball/comments/10crcmg/how_to_build_a_free_and_winning_starter_team/,How to build a free and winning starter team,2023-01-16 01:44:35,"Our friend u/Zealousideal-Wait166 gave me this idea because I was looking for such an amount for him and couldn't find one. If you have any additions, please feel free to add them in the comments. For this tutorial, I'm assuming that new users have just joined and didn't get Mbappe or Messi for free.

**First of all: Building a strong team doesn't need real money.**

You get everything you need for free and with a bit of grind for GP.

&#x200B;

* **Let's start with the goalkeeper**

There's really only one choice here: **Donnarumma** (PSG, French 1st division). He costs 390,000 GP, but it's worth every single penny. It's not without reason that most pros use him. Make sure you invest enough points in GK Parrying (GK 2) to avoid easy rebound goals. If you still want an alternative, there is Oliver Kahn in the eFootball-Points Shop or Courtois for 490,000 GP.

&#x200B;

* **Let's get to the defense**

1. I recommend **Robertson** (Liverpool R, English Premier League) as a left-back. He combines all important skills: Pinpoint Crossing, Early Cross, Weighted Pass, Sliding Tackle, Interception, Man Marking, Acrobatic Clearance. Train him like this: 5 Shooting, 5 Passing, 4 Dribbling, 4 Dexterity, 12 Lower Body Strength, 8 Defending, the rest in his playing style. He becomes a lightning-fast all-purpose weapon with horse lungs and deadly crosses. He costs 280,000 GP.
2. As a right-back, I recommend **Trippier**, which is currently available for free as a 4\* contract. Train him at least 7 Passing, 7 Dexerity, 8 Lower Body Strength and 6 Defending, the rest you can distribute freely. He also tirelessly runs up and down the pitch and hits deadly crosses.
3. As a central defender, I can recommend many. It is important that you train them in speed, aggression, acceleration, physical contact and ball control (in that order). For starters, I suggest **Marquinhos** (PSG, French 1st League, 300,000 GP) and **L. Hernandez** (FC Bayern, German 1st League, 170,000 GP).

&#x200B;

* **Now let's move on to the midfield**

1. In your defensive midfield, you need a fast, aggressive anchorman as a DMF. At the beginning there is hardly a way past **Zakaria** (Chelsea B, English 1st League, 70,000 GP). The alternative is **Barrios** (Colombia National Team, 51,000 GP).
2. As a CMF, I suggest **Pedri**, which you can get for free with a 5\* nominating contract from the Free Match Pass. He is quite fast, smooth with the ball and has an excellent passing. If you like it a little more defensive, take a closer look at **Barella** (Internazionale Milano, Italian 1st League). He costs 260,000 GP, but comes with what is probably the most complete all-round package, you can then use him as a second DMF.
3. Then you should definitely buy **Paul Scholes** with your eFootball points. As [mentioned elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/eFootball/comments/10ckvhk/my_love_letter_to_paul_scholes/), he is arguably the most complete AMF in the game.

&#x200B;

* **Now we come to the attack**

1. Up front there's hardly a way around **Son** (Tottenham WB, English 1st League, 450,000 GP) on the left flank
2. and **Salah** (Liverpool R, English 1st League, 1,100,000 GP) on the right. If you don't want to spend quite that much on Salah, you can go for **Dybala** instead (AS Roma, Italian 1st League, 180,000 GP).
3. As a center forward, you should either have a fast goalpoacher as your goal getter. Or a classic no 10/ deep-lying forward that drops back to allow your wingers to cut in and finish. Here I recommend you to start with as goal poacher **Aubameyang** (Chelsea B, 1st English league, 76,000 GP). If you prefer a forward who helps in linkup your play, then for little money I recommend **Depay** (FC Barcelona, ​​Spanish 1st League, 82,000 GP) or **Roberto Firmino** (Liverpool R, English 1st League, 82,000 GP). Later on, you should spend your GP on Mbappe (Goal Pocher) or Benzema (Deep-lying Forward).

Your starter team is ready, with which **you can easily reach higher divisions**. All together it costs costs around 2.5 million GP in the cheaper version (without Salah), which you should have collected quickly (about one to two weeks).

&#x200B;

* **For the bench I recommend you**

1. **Alaba** (Madrid Charmatin B, 1st Spanish League, 200,000 GP) - he can play all defensive positions (LB, CB, RB, CDM, CM) and is absolutely decent.
2. **Maitland-Niles** (Southhampton RW, 1st Spanish league, 14,000 GP) - absolute all-rounder, also lightning fast.
3. **Ben Yedder** (AS Monaco, 1st French league 82,000) or Muriel (Atalanta BC, 1st Italian league, 82,000) - fast and technically strong forwards with **Super sub**\-skill.
4. **Chiesa** (Piemonte BN, Italian 1st League, 170,000 GP) - **Super sub**\-skill and perfect skillset for both winger positions.
5. **Correa** (Internazionale Milano, Italian 1st Division, 51,000) - **Super sub**\-skill and hole player, finds spaces when opposing defense is tired.

&#x200B;

* As a **formation**, I recommend a vanilla (i.e. unchanged) 4-2-1-3, you can make one of the two defensive midfielders a CDM, but you can also play with two DMF. As a playstyle, I recommend either Possession if you like to build up with the ball and a lot of passes, or Quick Counter if you want to quickly bypass the midfield.

I'm happy to answer any questions, but don't expect too much from me, currently I'm ""only"" a div2 player. ;)

Also, you should definitely **watch tutorials**. I **recommend the tutorials** from Youtubers [LFFL](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXQVQELIuHHKms2D0xRk1A4Q2pZTwFPtR) and [eFootballUniverse](https://www.youtube.com/@eFootballUniverse/videos).

&#x200B;

Final note: In [this picture](https://share-your-photo.com/ef180af562) you can see an example with unleveled players and a randomly selected trainer. Of course you have to train your players and choose a suitable trainer who brings as many points as possible for the playstyle you prefer (the most expensive and best versions are Roman for Possession and Zeitzler for Quick Counter)."

>***Incineration Cannon***  
>  
>Prometheans used this specific weapon when assaulting a location believed to **hold a Gravemind**, or **even early-forming spore mountains**, where Forerunner Command deemed the infestation too small to invoke ship weapons, but far too large to be dealt with traditional infantry arms.  
>  
>(*Halo 4 the Essential Visual Guide, p.101*)

&#x200B;

>***Incineration Cannon***  
>  
>Created **to topple the nightmarish spore mountains** of the Flood, burn their wretched blight beasts from the surface of dead worlds, and annihilate nascent keyminds before they could spread their malignant influence, the Incineration Cannon was a favored weapon of the Forerunner general known as the Didact, and *vast quantities* of the weapon were created to arm his Promethean forces in the years before his confinement in Requiem.  
>  
>(*Halo Waypoint, Universe, Weapons, Incineration Cannons*)

Back then, I mentioned that Gravemind [has no official figures](https://imgur.com/a/tgTya2w) regarding its size.

However, ***I was dead wrong***...

According to the 2011's version of the Encyclopedia, it was stated:

>***Physical Characteristics***  
>  
>Physically, the Gravemind is a massive **tentacled** entity, somewhat resembling an engorged Venus flytrap with a gigantic fleshy neck, an indistinct head, and a prominent, massive mouth. It possesses huge tentacles of extraordinary length and strength, *each of which is capable of extending* ***hundreds of kilometers***.  
>  
>(*Halo Encyclopedia 2011, p.169*)

The description used a very general and non-specific tone, implying this isn't a special case but likely *very common* for a Gravemind to be this large...

As for the scale of the Spore Mountains, it's stated

>I pointed to a grayish patch on Uthera’s limb, even now sliding into darkness—but still, as it did so, shaping a visible bump against the thin starfield beyond. “Try focusing on that.” I said.  
>  
>“It is of considerable size,” the residue said. “Yet it does not appear to be a natural feature, nor a Forerunner construct. Ship will take a closer view.”  
>  
>That view—grainy and shimmering, as if through a rising column of hot air—revealed what I had dreaded most and seen only once, ten thousand years before: a spore mountain.  
>  
>The Flood.  
>  
>“The object rises **fifty kilometers above the planet’s datum** and measures **four hundred kilometers across the base**, at its greatest diameter. It intersects many Forerunner constructs and appears to have arisen at the center of a major city, which city is, if memory serves—if this is truly Uthera—”  
>  
>(*Halo, Silentium, String 5*)

This also means the Incineration Cannon **was way more powerful** than I previously thought, beyond just destroying objects the size of mountain ranges. It was designed to destroy objects **the size of a small country**, placing the firepower at around or possibly beyond megaton-range... 

Now, how big would the smallest Gravemind be?

Well, first, we need to know a Gravemind always evolves from a Proto-Gravemind.

In Halo Wars 2 Awakening the Nightmare, we were introduced to a Proto-Gravemind that was in the process of ascending to a Gravemind.

Unfortunately, we still didn't get an official figure for its size, though it was described as ""a mountain""

>A measure of Gravemind's intellect remains, though its new vessel must feed and spread in order for it to manifest fully once again. With every Banished soldier that succumbs to its embrace, the Gravemind's re-emergence grows closer. **The mountain of half-dead flesh** quivers in anticipation, and the echo of timeless laughter rises from somewhere deep below.  
>  
>(Halo Wars 2, Phoenix Logs, Proto-Gravemind)

Then we got [the cutscene](https://youtu.be/ARePKGJfs9k?t=2586) to confirm it. Here, it was shown that the Proto-Gravemind was **several times larger** than a Retriever Sentinel hovering above, and that was **just its ""head""**...

The rest of that thing was likely still deep beneath the pit...

Now, we have to realize that a [Retriever Sentinel](https://imgur.com/a/EEjmW9M) itself was **three times** the size of [UNSC Forward Unto Dawn](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPtDmL1WYAQZIhb?format=jpg&name=large).

* That's still not as big as an actual Gravemind, and it's already the size of a mountain...

The Forerunners were practically using *the primary armaments on starships* in their infantry warfare.

Just how ridiculous was the Forerunner-Flood war truly???"

92,https://www.reddit.com/r/equipmentbuyandsell/comments/11rnwe3/various_types_of_dozer_and_blades_equipment/,Various Types of Dozer and Blades | Equipment Planet Equipment,2023-03-15 13:11:19," 

**There are types of dozer and blades** [**used in construction**](https://sellyourconstructionequipment.com/)**. The term “dozer” was first used in the nineteenth century to describe an operational mechanism attached to the front of track-type tractors. It was employed to scatter loose dirt out over the top of the overfill. The types of dozer and blades have evolved through time and is now utilized all around the world to conduct more difficult building operations.**

**How types of dozers and blades have evolved?**

**The dozer was originally referred to as a steel plate and an operational mechanism mounted on the front of track-type tractors. They were affixed to the front end of a pole drawn by horses or oxen and were made of wood. Their major job was to move loose dirt out as it gathered in the overfill. With the passage of time, types of dozers and blades was added to the machine’s front end, which was controlled by a rope windlass attached to the tractor’s mainframe.**

**Manufacturers began developing dozer blades that matched specifications and quality criteria in the mid-1940s. Both cable and hydraulically controlled versions were available. These track-type tractors were rapidly** [**dubbed “dozers**](https://sellyourconstructionequipment.com/)**” and were employed for a variety of projects such as motorways, dams, canals, and so on. For material lifting, cable controls were initially used. Dozers eventually gained an onboard computer that allowed the operator to control the blade and produce a specified design. Modern dozers are employed for activities like moving material and finishing grading, and they’ve evolved over time. A dozer is available in three sizes: small, medium, and giant. There are now a variety of undercarriage, drivetrain, and blade configurations, as well as a slew of other options. The name “dozer” now refers to tough machinery designed for harsher building jobs.**

**In modern Indian construction, different types of dozers and blades are employed.**

**India plans to spend up to 111 trillion rupees on infrastructure projects over the next four years, thanks to the large investment. Bulldozers are now widely used on roads, trains, and airports as a result of this. Bulldozer producers are now concentrating their efforts on technological advancements that will support the machine’s compact variations and features that will improve its performance on difficult terrains. Built-in intelligence is now available, allowing you to seamlessly integrate with leading GPS grade control systems. They are also available in a variety of power and handling configurations. In India, various types of dozers and blades are employed in road, mining, railway, and other** [**construction projects**](https://sellyourconstructionequipment.com/)**.**

**Types of dozers and blades** **come in a variety of shapes and sizes**

**Crawler Dozers**

**The crawler is a tracked dozer with a** [**tractor-like appearance**](https://sellyourconstructionequipment.com/)**. This large equipment is used to transport items from one location to another. A Hydrostatic Transmission System is standard on modern crawler dozers, allowing for variable or intermediate speed choices. The mainframe, which is made up of a track frame and connecting bars, was created using modern Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) technology. Dual-path closed-circuits with two variable displacement piston pumps and two 3-speed variable displacement travel motors are standard on contemporary models. For protection against rocks and stumps and to improve longevity, travel motors and final drives are installed inside the track shoe.**

**The use of large-size links, pins, bushings, and special dust seals considerably extends the life and reliability of the undercarriage. Dynamic brakes are used on dozers to guarantee that they operate safely. Light operating effort and good blade response are provided by the 3-axis PPC valve and ergonomically built joystick. All directional movements are controlled using a PCCS (Palm Command Control System) joystick. The blade is easily visible because of the engine hood and well-placed operator seat. This improved blade visibility improves grading efficiency and eliminates operator guesswork. The models are made to maximize the curvature of the blades. Because of the broad blade radius, the material’s rolling-up performance can be enhanced by using the entire blade. This allows for high production while still retaining grading capabilities.**

&#x200B;

**This machine, which is also known as a tire dozer, is often larger than a crawler. Wheel dozers have sturdy frames that may last for many years and resist the harshest environments. It has a full box-section rear frame that can withstand torsional and twisting pressures. The installation of the axles has been adjusted to improve structural integrity. The Steering and Transmission Integrated Control System combines directional selection, gear selection, and steering into a single lever on the new models.**

**Powershift transmission is consistent thanks to the Advanced Productivity Electronic Control System’s integrated electronic controls. Fuel-saving features include a mechanically operated electronic unit-injection system, engine-idle-shutdown and engine-idle kick-down systems, delayed-engine-shutdown system, and on-demand and hydraulically powered cooling fan on the latest wheel dozers. Automatic temperature control, touch-screen display with soft keypad, electro/hydraulic parking brake, and the Comfort III seat with air-ride suspension and inbuilt controls are all available in the operator cab.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wgutkzm5huna1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=db7c5a1e2fd4f8207bdd56ad98b4dba8c1c89a70

 

**Miniature bulldozers**

**A tiny dozer, sometimes known as a mini dozer, is used for activities that demand more mobility and flexibility than larger equipment. Technology advancements and a new low-emission, fuel-efficient engine are among the features of today’s tiny dozers. It has a redesigned lower sloping hood line that increases finish grade efficiency by improving vision to the periphery view and the blade’s cutting edge. The models had blade capacities ranging from 1.85 to 1.98 cubic metres, 92 horsepower, and operational weights ranging from 8,319 to 8,627 kg. These machines’ Eco mode allows the engine to automatically offer maximum speed and power until the load lowers.**

**A 25-cm primary display with color touchscreen and access to many of the standard and optional advanced technology features is also included in the new model. By supplying the chassis in the cross-slope direction, the slope Assist feature in compact dozers enhances operator efficiency when operating on slopes. This also works in tandem with the operator’s blade control input, making it easier, faster, and with less effort to complete the grade.**

**Dozers that are hybrids**

**These types of dozers and blades feature electrical components and have a blade combination that can work in both soggy and difficult terrains. The current generation of hybrid dozers excels in load responsiveness, maximum torque, power, and fuel efficiency. The turbocharged engine with an Air-to-Air intercooler uses well-proven multi-injection technology to improve torque back-up and fuel efficiency while lowering engine noise and vibrations. The common rail FPT Industrial engine’s hydrostatic transmission provides best-in-class pulling capacity and controllability. The radiators in the new models are positioned without overlap, allowing each radiator to get fresh air and maintain stable fluid temperatures.**

**The hydrostatic fan adjusts its speed in real time to match the actual cooling need, lowering power consumption. The reverse mode decreases the amount of maintenance required and extends the time between cleanings. For great machine controllability and faster cycle times, the driver can modify all of the working parameters. The cab controls provide a variety of electronic settings and automatic tasks to assist the driver.**

**Dozer Blades of Various Types**

**The blades used in the aforementioned types can be further categorised. Varied blades have different functions, can handle various materials, and can bear a variety of load weights.**

* **Straight Blades (S-Blade) –** **This is the smallest** [**blade dozer**](https://sellyourconstructionequipment.com/) **with no surface wings. In the bottom back corners of the blade, this blade connects to the arm.**
* **U-Blade (Universal Blade) —** **This blade has lengthy edges and a curved design, making it suitable for transferring material to longer parts. It’s useful for transporting commodities across vast distances. It’s the tallest and widest blade kind, and it works well with mild to medium-density soil.**
* **S-U (SEMI-U) Blade —** **This blade combines the S-blade with the U-blade to offer adequate penetration. It’s perfect for moving soil over great distances.**
* **Angle Blade – This blade is mounted to the bulldozer’s panel in the middle. Because it can tilt close to 30 degrees left or right, it’s for shifting garbage to the side.**
* **Power-Angle-Tilt (PAT) Blade —** **This blade can tilt at any angle in practically all directions. It can be controlled from the cabin. Scraping, land clearing, leveling, backfilling, and grading are all tasks that it is employed for.**

Screw gameplay, because no way in hell would a rifle designed by a race of techno-demigods have a comparable damage output to one designed by contemporary humanity. In lore, they were indeed portrayed [more respectfully](https://youtu.be/d3Vcu_5-vtQ?t=62); however, the full extent of their destructive potential was still only vaguely described.

This isn't the case with [the Incineration Cannon](https://halo.wiki.gallery/images/thumb/4/48/H4-Concept-IncinerationCannon-Final.jpg/1280px-H4-Concept-IncinerationCannon-Final.jpg), Warrior-Servants' equivalents of a SPNKR, except that it fired [five clusters of **condensed** **antimatter**](https://imgur.com/rTkWQPL). In fact, the weapon's basic descriptions completely unapologetic in describing just how broken it was...

>Prometheans used this specific weapon when assaulting a location believed to **hold a Gravemind**, or even early-forming spore mountains, where Forerunner Command deemed the infestation too small to invoke ship weapons, but far too large to be dealt with traditional infantry arms.  
>  
>(Halo 4 the Essential Visual Guide, p.101)

Halo Waypoint further elaborated on that:

>Created **to topple the nightmarish spore mountains** of the Flood, burn their wretched blight beasts from the surface of dead worlds, and annihilate nascent keyminds before they could spread their malignant influence, the Incineration Cannon was a favored weapon of the Forerunner general known as the Didact, and *vast quantities* of the weapon were created to arm his Promethean forces in the years before his confinement in Requiem.  
>  
>(Halo Waypoint, Universe, Weapons, Incineration Cannons)

Before I mentioned the official figure regarding the dimensions of a Gravemind or the presumably larger Spore Mountain, I want to talk about the Proto-Gravemind, because every Gravemind evolved from  a Proto-G.

* How large is a Proto-Gravemind

In Halo Wars 2 Awakening the Nightmare, we were introduced to a Proto-Gravemind that was in the process of evolving into a Gravemind.

Unfortunately, we still didn't get an official figure for its size, though it was described as *""a mountain""*.

>A measure of Gravemind's intellect remains, though its new vessel must feed and spread in order for it to manifest fully once again. With every Banished soldier that succumbs to its embrace, the Gravemind's re-emergence grows closer. **The mountain of half-dead flesh** quivers in anticipation, and the echo of timeless laughter rises from somewhere deep below.  
>  
>(Halo Wars 2, Phoenix Logs, Proto-Gravemind)

Then we got [the cutscene](https://youtu.be/ARePKGJfs9k?t=2586) to confirm it. Here, it was shown that the Proto-Gravemind was **several times larger** than a Retriever Sentinel hovering above, and that was **just its ""head""**...

The rest of that thing was likely still deep beneath the pit...

Now, we have to realize that a [Retriever Sentinel](https://imgur.com/a/EEjmW9M) itself was **three times** the size of [UNSC Forward Unto Dawn](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPtDmL1WYAQZIhb?format=jpg&name=large).

Based on scaling, this thing might be around the size of a **UNSC** **Cruiser**, and an actual Gravemind was **larger than that**. According to [this official artwork](https://halo.wiki.gallery/images/d/d1/Enc22_FloodArtwork.png), the mountain-dwarfing ""head"" was just one of the Gravemind's many tentacles.

And here's how big the Gravemind actually was according to the 2011 edition of the Encyclopedia:

>***Physical Characteristics:***
>
>Physically, the Gravemind is a massive tentacled entity, somewhat resembling an engorged Venus flytrap with a gigantic fleshy neck, an indistinct head, and a prominent, massive mouth. It possesses huge tentacles of extraordinary length and strength, **each of which is capable of extending hundreds of kilometers**.
>
>(*Halo, Encyclopedia 2011, p.169*)

The description used a very general and non-specific tone, implying this isn't a special case but likely *very common* for a Gravemind to be this large...

As for the scale of one of the known Spore Mountains, it was stated:

>I pointed to a grayish patch on Uthera’s limb, even now sliding into darkness—but still, as it did so, shaping a visible bump against the thin starfield beyond. “Try focusing on that.” I said.“It is of considerable size,” the residue said. “Yet it does not appear to be a natural feature, nor a Forerunner construct. Ship will take a closer view.” That view—grainy and shimmering, as if through a rising column of hot air—revealed what I had dreaded most and seen only once, ten thousand years before: a spore mountain.The Flood.“The object rises **fifty kilometers above the planet’s datum** and measures **four hundred kilometers across the base**, at its greatest diameter. It intersects many Forerunner constructs and appears to have arisen at the center of a major city, which city is, if memory serves—if this is truly Uthera—”(*Halo, Silentium, String 5*)

The Incineration Cannons were used to destroy targets ranging in size from mountains (*conservative interpretation*) to a small country (*highest end interpretation*).

* Furthermore, it wasn't just about the physical scale of a Gravemind, the layers of hides and organic armor plates it covered itself with were surprisingly durable.

During the same mission, Pavium and Vordius set up several Antlion-type heavy siege turrets in order to defeat the Proto-Gravemind.

The Banished Antlions were [upgraded versions](https://imgur.com/G5MxiK8) of the ones used by the Covenant which were already [capable](https://imgur.com/YE53Qzs) of not just obliterating enemy fortifications but **burning down the ground beneath and forming craters**.

However, [one direct hit](https://youtu.be/HU1ralS7vas?t=846) merely forced its tentacle to withdraw. And concentrated hits from all turrets on the main body only served to make Vordius [admit](https://youtu.be/HU1ralS7vas?t=1889) that even the heavy plasma artillery couldn't do anything.

On the other hand, the *baseline* Incineration Cannons carried by Forerunner footsoldiers were designed to destroy eldritch abominations stronger than that.

#  Now, let's talk about the specialized variant.

Unfortunately, we only have in-universe description for one special variant of the IC — ***River of Light***.

>***Raging River:***
>
>One of the first Incineration Cannons ever made, the River’s core had been built and refined over decades by an unknown Promethean who served with distinction and honor in dozens of containment operations. **The cannon's harmonious energies** burned uncounted fetid burrows to ash and **toppled grand Spore Towers** dedicated to the parasite.  
>  
>(*Halo Waypoint, Canon Fodder - Uncharted Waters*)

How large was a Spore Tower?

According to the latest [Encyclopedia](https://imgur.com/XBrtT1G), Spore Towers were universally categorized as **the largest structures**, dwarfing the already enormous Spore Mountains, on a Flood-infested world and were **city-sized** (possibly a continent-spanning one or something that was visible from orbit, which [isn't unheard of](https://imgur.com/94iAcVc) even in the contemporary era of the Halo-verse), likely referring to their width, and as for height, it was said to **rise to the sky** [in great peaks](https://imgur.com/MFUIV0M).

And as I've noted, this was just one of the several [several specialized variants](https://imgur.com/LR3KTm3) of the Incineration Cannons, including another type known as the ***Heartseeker***.

Sources for continent-spanning cities during the ancient time of the Forerunners:

>***Charum Hakkor***:  
>  
>The center of human confluence and might was Charum Hakkor, one of the fifteen worlds within the Nov Thasta system, which included Faun Hakkor, Sothra Hakkor, and Ben Nauk. Many of these played host to remarkable repositories of Precursor technologies, even vast, **continent-spanning cities** sustained by unaged Neural-Physical composites.  
>  
>(*Halo, Encyclopedia 2022, p.27*)

Bornstellar also noted his home planet was covered in vast arrays of architecture visible from space:

>Of course our family’s homeworld had changed little. What need for change when every square meter of its surface had been built upon, tuned, and adapted to Forerunner comfort and ambition? Even **from a thousand kilometers, the arc of the planet’s limb was visibly ruffled with architecture**, though certainly not the equal of the ruins found on any great Precursor planet—no vaulting orbital bridges stretching from world to world, no unbending and eternal cables.…  
>  
>(*Halo, Cryptum, chapter 28*)

Want to see an even earlier example??? Watch [Halo Legends Origins](https://youtu.be/oqk7wA_YKBU) (1:55) released in 2010.

However, if someone prefers a mid-end interpretation, then you could go for the cities of the contemporary era of Halo for scaling.

Or a bit more conservative and use a real-life city instead...

* In conclusion:

if you find yourself facing an enemy wielding this weapon, well... you don't have to worry about anything at all... Seriously, just lay down your weapons and shields...

And don't bother to call for reinforcement of any kind... [The ships you called in for help ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyG3arHWBog&list=PLrr7vtmEObyT9TNVtrvzyajxIjvKgYl74&index=4)would just be one shot from the ground...

* In light of a few readers having questions regarding the discrepancy between the weapon's lore and its performance in the game, I've gathered some relevant information to come up with a speculative explanation:

>In the dead hands of a Knight the **River of Light**’s true potential could never be unlocked, but the artifact’s heart knows its name and purpose, and hungers to be remembered once more by warriors whose hearts pump with life and limbs move with purpose and intent.  
>  
>(*Halo, Waypoint, Canon Fodder, Uncharted Water*)

So there seem to be a built-in function that limit the weapon's destructiveness when being wielded by ""unsuitable"" users.

The Spartan Field Manual seemed to imply a similar trait.

>The configuration of this weapon is highly variable, though *only minimal control* of this weapon can be exerted through Mjolnir's Neural Link conversion/interpreter software.  
>  
>(*Halo, Spartan Field Manual, p.156*)

This is also similar to the answers Kelly Gay told me in a her email.

Yes, the Kelly Gay who wrote Rubicon Protocols, Point of Light, Renegades, and the upcoming Epitaph.

My question:

>Hi, Miss Gay.  
>  
>Thank you for the answer. It provides a great many contexts behind the action.  
>  
>However, there's one more question regarding the scene I still have in mind, and if you don't mind me asking:   
>  
>Did Spark dial up his Light Rifle's power settings for maximum destructiveness? You did mention he was able to transform his Armiger body, so I think why not...  
>  
>Although we do know that Forerunner weapons can be tuned for multiple sets of power level, like Light Rifle's scope-in mode in Halo 5 could produce a much more destructive bolt, I'm not sure if my speculation is correct.

Her reply:

>Right. Since the Light Rifle is an extension of his armiger form and subject to the same properties, he can manipulate the response/effectiveness of its power

Only the individuals that can *""form connections""* with Forerunner weapons can use them to their full extent.

Edit 1: Inclusion of the scale of the Gravemind and the Spore Mountains.

Edit 2: Explanation of the inconsistent performance between the game and the lore.

### 2. When was the idea behind Monsterra born, and what led to it?

Before starting the project, we had a process of 3 months of market and other NFT Games research at that time, combined with the experience of the game development  team. In the ""GameFi'' industry, there are a lot of scam projects or games that focus too much on ""earning'', resulting in ""short longevity"" due to inflation. Furthermore, gamers don't have enough fun, so they leave so soon. As far as we are concerned, a long-distance game is a game with at least three elements: addictive gameplay, attractive and competitive earnings, and excellent teamwork. That's why we generate & develop Monsterra and its ecosystem.

The game sets foot in a fictional world and revolves around farming, property building, and battling with other lands with the magical creatures named Mongen. The revolutionized design of Monsterra is a combination of free-to-play, play-for-fun and play-to-earn models which allows millions of gaming enthusiasts to enjoy fun and have a high-profit stream with no prior investment.

There are 5 races of Mongen in the game: Tectos, Mystic, Beast, Celest and Chaos. 2 of them, Celest & Chaos, will be revealed in the upcoming Battle phase. The game has 4 battle modes which are Adventure mode, Boss Challenge mode, Battlefront mode, Arena mode.

Monsterra's ecosystem is also extremely attractive with many elements in the rich ecosystem including:

### 3. Tell us something about your team's background.

**CMO of Monsterra NFT Game, IRIS LE**

Above all, we build a long-term vision and share a deep passion about P2E games together. The whole have spent months conducting research, investigating the market and analyzing existing games to be able to design the best product with attractive gameplay, balanced in-game economy and magnificent graphics.

### 4. What are the main advantages of Monsterra NFT Game for the user, compared to a similar project from a mainstream financial market?

With Monsterra, our team strives to deliver a revolutionary P2E game that transforms existing Play-to-earn games into the fun zone.

For gameplay, we assure that Monsterra is the most addictive game till now in the blockchain field with the following USPs:

* **Unprecedented Breeding Mechanism:** Players can create new animals with different figures by breeding 2 random entities of in-game creatures. Monsterra character set, therefore, will be unique Mongens collectibles with infinite diversity.
* **Unique Land Shaping and Customization Mechanics:** Gamers can customize their own lands to create different shapes. This elevates the individuality and uniqueness in each player’s land.
* **Varied Land Theme:** In Monsterra, it is easy to modify land themes according to different seasons  (Mid Autumn Festival, Halloween, Merry Christmas or Lunar New Year etc). The brand identities of Monsteras’ partners (investors, marketing partners, etc) can also be embedded in the land plots.
* **Earning while off-line:** Players are able to earn when successfully attacking other player’s land, but they can also earn for successfully defending their base from an enemy’s attack, making it possible to earn even while not playing the game.

Other than that, our game has some more other points that are being designed better than other existing competitors:

* **Free Play and Earn:** Monsterra lets gamers play the game for free before actually spending on it. Players can experience a full-fledged core game (Collect → Develop → Battle → Collect) without any prior investment. It is for this reason, Monsterra is expected to bring the most exciting moments for playing and potential earning for a large number of gamers currently. Players can choose to use FREE assets or buy items on the Marketplace depending on their personal financial situation. When playing with free items, players can still experience all the features of the game. Yet, it will be even more fascinating for gamers with financial investment in NFTs assets. It is for this reason, we can  with confidence that Monsterra offers an equal opportunity to make a profit to all users.

Gamers using free assets or having a small amount of capital will need to spend more time and effort to farm, build an empire with wealthy properties, and Mongens while gamers spending a bigger financial investment in NFTs items can shorten the time to build a defense empire and generate profits faster when there are battles and events.

However, whether it is a small or big investment, gamers must set up their own wise strategy to maximize the profit generated. Monsterra offers plenty of interesting daily quests for free and low-capital players to be able to engage in. Everyone can entertain and earn as much as they can.

* **Prosperous Monsterra Universe:** Rich & Diversed Ecosystem of 8 Components (Gameplay, DAO, NFT Marketplace, Event, Guild Portal, Mini Games, Bridges and Mons TV)
* **Anti Inflation Mechanism (NFTs & Tokens):** We create in-game financial balance mechanisms including for tokens and NFTs. Users are publicly disseminated MSTR and MAG tokens for the purpose of spending and earning in the game and can come up with their own learning strategies. Additionally, we adjust and balance our mint / burn token mechanism regularly in the game to ensure a sustainable economy. NFT assets are limited by rarity and controlled by our financial simulation with tokens.
* **Multi-trending chains Integrated:** Now we are ready for BNB Chain, Avalanche, Terra and in the long run, we will partner with trending chains that bring as much value as possible for our gamers.

### 5. What is the Security Strategy of your project?

To further develop a better version of the cryptocurrency market with the highest level of security, we already had chosen Certik— the leading security-focused ranking platform — to perform extensive audits on our project. The audit is successfully evaluated. It is our honor to declare that our smart contracts are all secured. The report is published here:

[https://www.certik.com/projects/monsterra  ](https://www.certik.com/projects/monsterra)

Apart from Certik, we continue to audit with other partners. Currently, we are auditing all Smart Contracts with **Securichain** and performing backend audits. A third party audit can be conducted to increase security.

Organize **Bug Bounty programs** with great prizes to encourage the community to find vulnerabilities, as well as raise awareness of the project.

Even without a Bug Bounty program, users who report bugs and threats always receive a great reward to motivate them to do more. As a result, a mentality of active participation is created while reporting bugs to receive rewards rather than silently profiting from bugs.

Our team not only offers direct security solutions, but also tools for early and timely detection and tracing the cause of incidents. **Off-chain tracking solutions** to alert when large fluctuations occur in in-game cash flow is an example. Similarly, **a withdrawal delay** based on withdrawal amount can also be a solution for the team to find anomalies and security holes with large, suspicious transactions.

### 7. Why did you decide to migrate/build on the BNB Chain?

As everyone knows, BNB is the most popular chain today with a large number of users and gamers with the advantage of cheaper fees compared to other chains, so Monsterra chose BNB to develop the game to create an easily accessible mechanism to play free and experience the game with the best mechanics. Most of the hot game series are being deployed on BNB so we can minimize the risks for users when launching the game.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q89w5pp07xu91.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=104522a9a10bba8587c7d721bd4c5e6625b4d30e

The fact has proven that the first step is extremely right with impressive tractions in the first week of mainnet launch including:

✅ 50,000 gamers with average CCU rate 5,000 users at any time

✅ 99% good feedbacks about the gameplay

✅ \~$750K MSTR Staking in DAO Treasury

✅ Top 4 most outstanding gamefi projects on BNB chain by Dappradar

(https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/binance-smart-chain/category/games)

✅ Top 2 Most Searched Games (24h (https://playtoearn.net/trending-blockchaingames))

✅ Top 2 Treasury Boxes on Binance NFT Marketplace (https://www.binance.com/en-AU/nft/home) based on trading volume (Tab Mystery boxes)

✅ 1898% increase on social growth

✅ $ 2M MSTR Daily Trading Volume & Transaction by CMC (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monsterra/)

✅ 30K+ $MAG Trading Volume & Transaction

✅ 550K Trading Volume and 20K transactions in $MSTR on NFT Marketplace  


In addition, BNB Chain is also very careful in observing and supporting reliable, potential projects under strict vetting process and in-depth advice for long-term development. These timely actions both protect users on the vast ecosystem of BNB Chain and help complete projects, have more opportunities to gain wider access to a huge user base, expand the partners network quickly and speedily along with the opportunity to maximize the value and benefits of gamers through the Gas Free Program, Incubation or MVB V, etc

All of this has further cemented the role and value of BNB Chain in the global blockchain ecosystem and Monsterra appreciates BNB Chain's immense efforts.

### 8. What do you hope to see next from the BNB Chain community?

As a promising NFT Game project in the BNB Chain ecosystem, we hope and believe that in the near future BNB Chain can support and help many projects, not only Monsterra, by:

* Incorporating more realistic programs to support projects and users of BNB Chain such as Gas Fee Incentives, MVB, Incubation, etc. to support the BNB chain.
* Promoting the chain's co-operation via co-marketing with the project to increase visibility and emphasize the benefits for the users
* Introducing project to Binance Labs’s evaluation for future funding rounds

Hosting more offline and online events in Vietnam and worldwide thus creating and having more space for VCs, Projects and Crypto Enthusiast to get closer and go further with the networks & all projects on it.  


### 9. Where do you position your brand in the DeFi/NFT/GameFi / Metaverse space?

In about a more than 8-month journey, we received many objective reviews and expectations from our investors and our gamers. They particularly enjoy Monsterra's gameplay and business model, and believe that our team has the potential to make it the largest game in the industry and become a star of the year.

As for the Monsterra team, we believe in the team's ability and believe in the long-term development direction in the next 2 years. As of now, we become one of the top Gamefi projects on the BNB chain, then the top multi-chain project on other chains. Why so? Our development and formation were long enough, longer than other blockchain game projects, especially after the downtrend in crypto and gamefi, we still achieved outstanding results which rarely has a game achieved such a level. So there's no reason why we can't conquer more peaks with great support from the BNB Chain and our users.

### 14. Is there any upcoming events?

We are expecting to implement many additional deep and close activities in the ecosystem of BNB Chain, Monsterra also constantly develops and perfects products in parallel with marketing activities with global partners, especially reputable gaming communities around the world.

After the mainnet on August 25, 2022 with a series of exciting events season 1 with Adventure PvE Mode & The Mid-Autumn Festival, Battle Front officially launched on September 22, 2022 with many attractive prizes in a much hotter series of events. In this battle mode, players will lead their Mongen armies to raid other players' lands to ""rob"" the resources of the opponents. A series of events in the Battle Front Campaign are taking place as below:

1. TOP 10 MSTR Spending

2. MSTR Accumulative Spending Event

3. Weekly Raffle Event

4. MAG Accumulative Spending - Season 2

5. Staking Event

6. Referral Competition

And many other events with detailed information are constantly updated on https://event.monsterra.io/

More specifically, at the end of September and the beginning of October, the project is also preparing to launch  Mobile Application version on Android and IOS that allows players to freely play anytime, anywhere along with an impressive guild portal & Halloween event. Make sure to follow & keep updated with us to miss no latest information and events ahead.

https://preview.redd.it/40jj3w737xu91.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=118e29e82138c017b41ddd3120cf9d2270c7130e

Also, in next 3 months at the end of 2022, we will unlock other components in the ecosytems including:

* MonsTV
* Guild Portal
* Mini Games
* Bridges
* 2 more battle modes

### 15. Can we talk about the tokenomic model?

To minimize inflation, we also built the governance of the in-game economy through a dual token model, MSTR as the primary token with a limited supply of 100 million tokens and MAG as the in-game reward token with the unlimited supply. We do have a Smart Token Burning Mechanism to maintain the token supply and burning amount with a design of various tokens utilities and NFTs fusion sets (for both Mongens and lands). They will play the key role as anti-inflation mechanisms that help guarantee sustainable growth in the long run. The vast and rich ecosystem in Monsterra will develop a lot of token utilities to discover, spend and earn.

More details about MSTR & MAG spending, earning and burning mechanísm: [https://whitepaper.monsterra.io/token-and-tokenomic/mstr-and-mag-tokens/mstr-token](https://whitepaper.monsterra.io/token-and-tokenomic/mstr-and-mag-tokens/mstr-token)

**One more important update with the burning & minting mechanisms of MAG and MSTR as below:**

MAG: burn/mint is done by the following mechanism:

* At the end of each month: If the amount of $MAG being staked on the DAO is less than that figure in the Staking contract ==> The total amount of surplus tokens will be burned
* At the end of each week or in this case: If the amount of $MAG being staked on the DAO is higher than that figure in the Staking contract==> $MAG will be minted to maintain the user's token withdrawal process.

MSTR minting & burning mechanism:

* The burning mechanism will be deployed on a monthly basis
* The total game revenue will be divided into 3 main streams and allocated to: Development Fund, Shared revenue incentive to the community in DAO Treasury, and Token Burning. The burnt tokens will be announced on the 16th-18th of every month along with the transaction hash.

Problems still persist, and not just the issue noticed by Sillybutz. I have identified what I believe to be a solution to these issues to those willing to mod, and personally am happy with the resulting blaster, but I still would not recommend anyone purchase it.

The dart zone pro mk 1.2 has been a large part of controversy recently. During the Dart zone pro toar where it debuted, many players experienced numerous jams with it, leading to numerous controversies. Reviews have been very mixed on the 1.2, some reviewers experienced no issues whatsoever, and some experiencing a miriad of jams. There was a ~1 month long delay with the 1.2, leading to some hope that these issues would be ironed out over the delay. I recently got my blaster, and as you can probably tell from the title, the issues were not fixed.

**My experience with the Mk 1.2**

I was a finalist in the Dart Zone Pro Tour, competing with my hometown of Rochester. As such I was able to get early access to the 1.2 during their VIP event, and was going to receive one of them for free. During the press events, I did not spend much time with the 1.2, preferring to focus on the 2.1, as it was going to be my job on the team to run the 2.1 in tournament. I believe in retrospect I did experience a few of the jams during my time with it, however I did not think much of it at the time. During the tournament, I was able to see the issues on the 1.2 and how they played out and yeah, the jam issues are significant, especially if trying to be used in a competitive setting that the 1.2 is aimed at. Not everyone experienced these jams, but many did. These issues were also unique to the 1.2, previous dart zone pro style springers did not have these issues even when run very hard.

We then waited for our blasters to arrive as the delay came through. Just this past week, the blasters finally arrived to the teams, and they seemed to be having mixed/negative experiences. The bay teams received their blasters first and seemed to all have near universally negative experiences. My local teams seemed to be split in half. Some people were having major issues, while it was working just fine for some. Where was I? Well I was somewhere in the middle. When using the default setup for the blaster, I experienced very few if any issues. However, when I attempted to swap out the spring for the included low power spring, I near immediately began running into a multiple issues. See this dart folded in half in the barrel for an example (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/711379982802485331/1015448725574930432/IMG_2155.jpg). These issues most frequently occurred when I primed the blaster very quickly (note this is in terms of the speed of a single prime, not the rate of fire). This seemed to confirm to me that the variable success rate on the blaster is seemingly related to the way different people prime the blaster and there is a consistent methodology on all of this. If I was able to both replicate the issue and not replicate it with the only difference being the strength of the prime, that would indicate there is a methodology cause to all of this, as such I got investigating into the blaster to try to identify why these issues were happening.

**The Sillybutz fix**

One of the first notable stories about the 1.2 was an issue noticed by sillybutz during the early events for it. In an quick video, sillybutz demonstrated that the dart guide tooth could run into a piece of ribbing on the shell and cause jam issues. This issue could be fixed by making a cut to the shell to not interfere with the dart guide.

https://youtu.be/pgqQg_Lh18Y

This video seemed to show promise for the 1.2, as it did seem to drastically improve the issues from those who performed it. However, some reviewers who received the blaster early, and then performed the fix (notably Beret) still experienced many jam issues with the 1.2. Thus, while Silly's fix did seem to help, it was not the complete solution many had hoped for.

**My investigations**

Given that the speed of the initial prime seemed to have a factor on how reliable the blaster ended up being I decided to look into seeing if I could identify the differences and causes behind these jams. In my investigations I noticed a few things

1. The jams with the blaster only seemed to happen with half lengths, full lengths seemed to function just fine no matter what I did.

2. The dart guide on the 1.2 seemed to press down significantly on the darts, with it being able to drag half darts slightly backwards during the initial prime. This effect was most notable during slower primes bizarrely enough which were the more reliable ones.

3. Many of the jams I experienced involved more than one dart, even when I only primed the blaster once. This would indicate that darts were double feeding somehow.

After some discussion with some fellow users on the /r/nerf discord and some testing with a fellow teammate. We seemed to have identified the issue (or at least an issue).

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/146386512873783296/1015415869192540241/IMG_2160.mov 

The dart guide can press go down low enough that at can actually start pushing the darts forward on its own. While this isn't an issue by itself given that it retracts by the time it gets to the breach, the dart guide is significantly further forward that the mechanisms that are supposed to be pushing the dart forward. This leads to a large dead space in the mechanism that is just the right size for other darts to pop up, if sometimes only partially, and then get pushed by the mechanism that is supposed to be doing the pushing, and now we have two darts that are trying to go into the same place. This can cause a fabulous array of issues that we want none of. The reason this seems to only happen some of the time is that when darts are either dragged backwards by a slower prime or are naturally positioned in the back of the mag, the dart itself will block the guide from going low enough to start pushing it. When the dart is moved to the front of the mag and is not pulled back by the prime, it cannot do this.

**My solution**

Yeet the dart guide. It doesn't seem to be essential to the blaster, and has been the cause of both major issues identified with the blaster so far. It's probably possible to design a 3d printed part, to replace the dart guide that works correctly, but that would be a significant amount of effort for a part that seems to be causing significantly more problems than it helps with.

Removing the dart guide was not difficult. Thanks to the easy takedown of the 1.2 and the exposed breach area, I didn't even have to open up the blaster all the way. I unscrewed the panel that held the dart guide in through tho exposed breach, and let the panel, guide, and small spring associated fall out. Upon reassmbly, the blaster now seemed to function properly no matter how I primed it. Several other users who attempted the same fix as me reported similar results. As such, if you have a 1.2, I would recommend removing the dart guide for the sake of your poor darts.

The piece of plastic from hell in question

Thanks to everyone who helped out with these investigations. This has been a community effort to figure out what went wrong at this blaster and how the issues can be rectified.

**My thoughts on the blaster after all of this**

First thing to note is the stock, it's genuinely awful. It could work on a flywheel blaster that doesn't need too much structural integrity, but on a high power springer it's borderline unusable and likely will break if you use it too much. Fortunately, due to the fact that it's an n-strike stock attachment point, you can swap it out for another one. I've put a worker stock on mine, and that seems to work well enough, though there is a slight amount of wobble.

Aside from that I honestly am pretty happy with mine right now. It hits very hard, I really like the grips. The easy takedown and spring access are very handy. And the adjustable sights are nice. Given that I didn't have any high power springers before this, I will likely get some good use out of this. That being said...

**Would I recommend the blaster**

No. I enjoy using mine, especially now that I have fixed the issues, but I just can't recommend others do the same. For the price and the fact you will likely need to mod to get it working, I just don't think it's worth it, especially with the Trion coming on the market soon. If there's a sale, or you can pick one up for cheaper from an FPT player who doesn't want theirs, it might be worth considering. But just ordering one from amazon at full price isn't worth it right now IMO. There are other options for high power springers on the market right now, even injection molded ones, and I don't think the dart zone pro mk 1.2 offers enough as a package to be worth it right now considering the competition."

Many university students require financial support in today’s environment, and scholarships are the most preferred type of financial aid. The following are some of the most significant scholarship benefits.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l1g0guqg2qz91.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3d360bce551ba4f6af574a03435d38f3bbbd40eb

**Scholarship Benefits**

* **Educational Benefits**: Having a scholarship that pays for your education can actually reduce your risk of dropping out and not getting the degree you want. By reducing financial concerns, scholarships can also mean more time for learning and studying, which can lead to better grades and increase your chances for continuing on to postgraduate studies.
* **Career Benefits**: Earning a scholarship can actually make you a more attractive job candidate. Employers who understand the competitive nature of the scholarship will recognise it as an accomplishment and demonstrates that you have excellent academic skills every successful student needs. Scholarship benefits are accomplishments worth listing on your resume and can help you stand out when you search for a job and can even help you achieve the career you want.
* **Personal Benefits**: The money and security afforded by having a scholarship allows you to be more selective regarding how you spend your free time. Students can then use this time wisely and make the most of it. 

**Advantages Of Scholarships**

* **Financial Assistance**: The primary motto of scholarship benefits is to provide financial assistance to the students. Opposite to loans, scholarships are financial aid in which the student is under no obligation to pay it back. Therefore, scholarships do not put an extra burden on the students and, at the same time, help them to pursue their dreams and ambitions.
* **Focus On The Goals**: When a student is rewarded with a scholarship, the sole duty remains with him is to focus on his goals. He is freed from all kinds of financial burdens and tensions. He can now work hard and sincerely walk towards his goals.
* **Paying College Fees**: Not everyone is financially strong enough to pay for college. And in this situation, scholarships are boon to students who are finding difficulty in paying their college fees. A scholarship has made education from well-known universities accessible to all and, at the same time, reduced the financial burden of students and parents.
* **Helps To Get Admission In Popular Universities**: There are many influential colleges which are searching for extraordinarily skilled and talented students to add them into the existing group of students. For the same, they conduct various examinations and provide scholarships to those who clear the examination with flying colors. These students will increase the standards of the college and help existing students to grow. The college will also excel in the field of research and development, and the student who received the scholarship will be given adequate resources to perform the same.

Understanding how important scholarships are when making your decision to study overseas, at [FPT Education Global](https://international.fpt.edu.vn/), we offer a range of waiver scholarships for international students looking to undertake undergraduate study in Spring, Summer and Fall 2023 Intakes.

Each week, we'll listen to a piece recommended by the community, discuss it, learn about it, and hopefully introduce us to music we wouldn't hear otherwise :)

Last week, we listened to [Franck’s Prelude, Chorale, and Fugue](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/ye07cy/potw_44_franck_prelude_chorale_and_fugue/). You can go back to listen, read up, and discuss the work if you want to. 

Our next Piece of the Week is **Alberto Ginastera’s Variaciones Concertantes (1953)**

...

some listening notes from [John Henken](https://www.laphil.com/musicdb/pieces/4451/variaciones-concertantes)

> The Variaciones concertantes were composed in 1953, during a difficult period for Ginastera, as political conflicts with the Perón government forced him to resign as director of the music conservatory at the National University of La Plata. He supported himself by scoring films, as he had been since 1942, and accepting commissions such as the Variaciones, which came to him from the Asociación Amigos de la Música in Buenos Aires, where Igor Markevitch conducted the premiere in June 1953.

> This was a central work of the “subjective nationalism” of Ginastera’s second stylistic period, in which folkloric and traditional materials are idealized and sublimated in a personal way. One characteristic musical symbol of this is harmony derived from the open strings of the guitar, as heard in the harp under the solo cello statement of the theme at the beginning, and again before the final variation. (These pitches – E, A, D, G, B – also supply variation material and represent the main key areas of the whole set.)

> Two interludes (the first for strings, the second for winds) then frame seven character variations featuring different solo instruments with the orchestra. The first is a spunky scamper for the flute (Variazione giocosa), which leads directly into an edgier romp featuring clarinet (Variazione in modo di Scherzo). The haunting elegy for the viola (Variazione drammatica) is much the longest of the group. Its modal chords seem to spill over into the next variation, a dusky duet for oboe and bassoon (Variazione canonica). The brief, brilliant variation for trumpet and trombone (Variazione ritmica) is basically a splashy fanfare for the ensuing violin whirlwind (Variazione in modo di Moto perpetuo). To close this central group of variations, the horn offers a lyrically poised take on the original theme (Variazione pastorale).

> Ginastera rounds this off with a reprise of the main theme, again accompanied by the harp but this time with double bass taking up the tune. A final variation, for the full ensemble, ensues (Variazione in modo di Rondo). This is a high-voltage malambo, the competitive gaucho dance that was another prime symbol for Ginastera. The steady repeated notes represent tapping feet, with virtuosic and jazzy flourishes coming from all instrumental points.

**1. Healthy everyday habits**

As you move out and start living on your own, competency in general tasks such as cooking and cleaning facilitates a healthy lifestyle for you to prosper in. Though cooking may be seen as a way to simply acquire sustenance, it can also be a form of self-care. Cooking and baking are great alternatives to dealing with stress while also making sure your body receives the energy it needs to function to its fullest. A common struggle for college students is eating healthy food consistently while staying on budget. Healthy eating and the value of prioritizing how much money to spend and what to spend it on are both significant skills you’ll need throughout college and beyond. Organization also plays a role in limiting your stress at university. As the saying goes, a clean space makes a clear mind. Maintaining the appearance of your surroundings—while simultaneously consuming fueling food—will improve your productivity and, in turn, the efficiency of your workspace.

**2. Mental health awareness and self-care**

Focusing on yourself and your mindset through self-care should take priority when you go to college. Maintaining self-discipline is also a significantly difficult feat, though attainable through time and self-motivation. In college, doing simple tasks that you may have previously done with ease in middle or high school can often seem harder or require more persistence and determination. Reminding yourself that it’s okay to struggle sometimes—especially since those around you are in different positions as well—is crucial in terms of self-acceptance. In addition, comprehending that your fellow classmates are at various points in their lives and aren’t moving at the same pace as you can help you overcome any insecurities and misgivings you may have about college life.

**3. Social skills**

Throughout college, your cognition of society will be exemplified through your communication with others and your willingness to adapt. Engaging in social activities may seem unnecessary or just like amusing events. However, they can prepare you for future circumstances where involvement with different groups of people can make or break a job opportunity, business deal, and more. Practicing the art of communication and understanding people when you still have time for trial and error can lead to an enhanced sense of socialization in the future. Embracing your responsibility for and participation in certain events welcomes mistakes and generates the ability to learn from them.

Before you set foot on campus, it’s helpful to try to understand yourself better; spend time with yourself, getting to know your body, your limits, your aspirations, and your mentality. Being in tune with yourself before you start college enables you to truly enjoy the journey. Of course, this is a time of self-discovery, but attaining a sense of self-consciousness beforehand can help you navigate college life more securely.

If you want to step out of your comfort zone by studying abroad, you can take a while to discover a range of programs in both [mobility](https://international.fpt.edu.vn/mobility-programs) and [degree](https://international.fpt.edu.vn/undergraduate-programs) that [FPT Education Global ](https://international.fpt.edu.vn/)is offering for international students to study in Vietnam at affordable costs.

Studying abroad is great, but it comes with more effort in the process of applying and attending. Here are six things you need to consider before going abroad.

**1. The cost of studying abroad**

If you're a student and want to study abroad, the cost can be a huge deciding factor. However, scholarships and financial aid are available for students who want to study abroad. Do your research and explore all your financial options before deciding. You need to figure out how much you’ll need to sustain yourself comfortably. Consider the cost of tuition and fees, which can differ significantly from one university to another.

**2. Learning the language**

Even if English is the primary language of instruction in the country you're studying in, there may be times when you’ll have to communicate in a local language. In general, studying abroad presents an excellent opportunity to learn a new language through immersion. No matter what country you're studying in, you'll need to know how to order food, ask for directions, and talk to locals in their native language. Learning the basics of the local language will make your stay more enjoyable and help you make friends.

**3. The culture shock**

Cultural differences can be one of the biggest adjustment challenges for international students. Be aware of the customs and traditions of your host country before you arrive. This way, you'll avoid cultural faux pas and adjust to your new surroundings more easily. For instance, it's considered rude to make direct eye contact when speaking to someone in some cultures, while in others, it’s considered more respectful. Knowing the local customs will also help you make friends more easily and avoid accidentally offending anyone.

**4. Clubs and societies**

Joining a club or society on campus is a great way to make friends and settle into your new surroundings. It's also an excellent way to learn more about the local culture. Be sure to research what kind of opportunities are offered at your schools of interest before studying abroad. If you're interested in sports, look out for club teams and student gyms. If you're more of a culture vulture, look for book clubs and art galleries. There are groups and facilities for almost every interest, so you're sure to find ones that are perfect for you.

Studying abroad is a big decision, but it can be one of the greatest experiences if you're fully prepared for it. Keep these things in mind as you plan your studies, and you'll be on your way to a successful and enriching life in a new country.

If you are looking for an appropriate course to study abroad on a budget, you can take a while to discover a range of programs in both [mobility](https://international.fpt.edu.vn/mobility-programs) and [degree](https://international.fpt.edu.vn/undergraduate-programs) that [FPT Education Global ](https://international.fpt.edu.vn/)is offering for international students to study in Vietnam at affordable costs.

117,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/xeybhi/how_to_plumb_in_sump_pump_extension_from_15_pvc/,"How to plumb in sump pump extension from 1.5"" PVC to 4"" PVC Wye",2022-09-15 21:31:30,"Right now my sump pump in my basement pumps up from the slab through a 1.5"" PVC, through the foundation, and out, into a 2"" corrugated pipe, which a drains under my deck. This leaves a wet spot in the lawn all summer so far because the AC condensate pumps into the sump pump, which in turn gets pumped out.

I have inground downspout drainage, and a connect close by where the sump exists the foundation. The pump exits around the corner from the downspout, but only 2' away, and 12"" higher. 

My plan was to disconnect the 2"" corrugated from the sump pump outside of the foundation, and connect a smaller hose (1.5 or 1.25"") and put it into the PVC connection.

[I found this sump pump drain kit, which has 1 1/4"" ID tubing](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Superior-Pump-24-ft-Poly-Universal-Discharge-Sump-Pump-Hose-Kit-99624/301289397)


But the issue is the PVC wye (which is used as a cleanout and is glued) is on the wrong side from where I want it.

What is the best way to connect tubing into my set up, and is there a better option than the sump drain kit I linked?

My plan for right now is going to put a [1-1/2"" PVC Female x FPT adapter](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Charlotte-Pipe-1-1-2-in-PVC-Schedule-40-Female-S-x-FPT-Adapter-PVC021011400HD/203811414) on the end of my PVC stub out, then use the supplied 1-1/2 in. NPT hose adapter. But not sure how to connect it to the larger PVC wye. I was just going to cut a hole in the clean out cap and jam the pipe in, but I know I can do better than that. Also, with the wye the way it is, the tubing is going to have to make a hard 180 degree turn. Maybe remove the grate and put a 90 elbow (do they make 90 male to male elbows? all I see are hubs x hub, which would mean I'd need another small section to connect) on there?. I dont think I have enough height difference to put another wye facing the other direction.

From volunteering to taking advantage of work-integrated learning opportunities, there are many ways you can build your resume both inside and outside the classroom. Today, we’re highlighting just a few options international students have at their disposal to help them graduate with a resume that will wow any future employer! 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fqio4yarrtr91.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=22286d39612a29ce021fb93eec2c685eef54d523

**1. Join a Club or Team**

Employers love to see that you’re able to effectively balance multiple competing demands and commitments. A great way to demonstrate this is by joining clubs and teams at your university or college that complement your skills and interests. Not only is this an excellent way to strengthen your resume, it can also help you meet people, have fun, and create special memories during your time as an international student. 

Regardless of what area you pursue, having an extracurricular activity will look good on your resume and it’s a bonus if it’s related to your studies and career objectives. 

**2. Volunteer**

Volunteering is one of the best ways to build up your resume. It shows that you’re community-minded and a self-starter, and it can be a great way to connect with local people and issues at your study abroad destination. It’s essential to be strategic when selecting an organization where you’d like to volunteer. Consider how this organization and position will impress future employers, and do your research before applying to see how you’d fit into the organization. 

**3. Work-Integrated Learning**

These days it isn’t enough to graduate with a good degree. Employers often expect graduates to have some real work experience related to their field of study. Selecting a program or course that offers work-integrated learning opportunities is one of the best ways to help you stand out from the competition and boost your resume.   

Work-integrated learning helps students build relationships with industry colleagues and prospective employers while preparing them to transition from their studies to the world of work. It will also help students gain additional soft and hard skills they can add to their resumes.

**4. Make an Effort to Network**

Networking is “about building relationships and connecting with others: people you know, people you don’t really know, and new people you’ve never met before.” It also happens to be one of the best ways to obtain references you can later use when applying for a job. References are individuals who can talk about your work experience, character, skills, and work habits. So you must select these individuals carefully—and make sure you have their permission first! 

Following these four tips will help you build your network, gain work experience, open doors, and ultimately strengthen and diversify your resume.

If you are looking for an appropriate course to study abroad on a budget, you can take a while to discover a range of programs in both mobility and degree that [FPT Education Global ](https://international.fpt.edu.vn/)is offering for international students to study in Vietnam at affordable costs.

Many international students have never left home before and we know it can be scary. As an international student you may experience homesickness and you may struggle with adjusting to your new surroundings. We are here to remind you that this stress is normal. But we are pleased to let you know that we have some tips for you to deal with the stress of your new life in a foreign country.

**International Offices**

These offices exist to help you and answer any questions you may have about your school, your program or life in a new country. Since you will most likely be arriving in a new country with many questions, the International Offices are a great place to contact first. They will also try to help you feel more comfortable in these new surroundings. 

**Connect with Students**

It’s always good to get to know your classmates. You may end up becoming very good friends with someone who is in your class. There are usually many common areas on campus which are great areas to hang out in to meet new people. Going to school or community events is another great way to meet people. This is also a good opportunity for you to be involved with the culture of the new country you are now living in. Moreover, you will have the chance to meet students who speak your original language and who are going through the same feelings that you are. Meeting students who are going through the same issues will help you feel like you aren’t the only one feeling uncomfortable in a new area.

**Issues with Academics**

Sometimes no matter how hard you try you may still have difficulties with school projects and assignments in college or university. If you are feeling stressed about school work, talk to your teachers! Most teachers want to be there to help students be successful in their academic career. 

**Travel Around the City**

&#x200B;

[Danang city, Vietnam - the country's most livable city to live, study and work.](https://preview.redd.it/xa5z17y7i2o91.jpg?width=1627&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=585b844f62a19c6802264056e93ad5efaa4fdad9)

Being in an unfamiliar area can be scary. So try to explore the new city you are living in. You may feel more comfortable in the new city once you have explored your surroundings. Why not use some of your spare time to explore the city and get to know the area around you. You could possibly ask your classmates what their favorite things to do around the city are. You will be able to experience a new culture and meet new people.

Overall, becoming an international student can be challenging. But just remember that it will take time for you to adjust. It may take a while for you to feel comfortable in your new life as an international student.

As an international student, you will gain a wealth of career-enhancing skills and experiences that employers around the world will recognize and support.

1. **Communication skills**

One of the most valued career benefits of studying abroad that you will develop is the ability to communicate across multiple language barriers. During your time abroad, you will meet, interact, and become friends with students from around the globe - so you will be surrounded by a wealth of foreign languages and different languages abilities.

You will learn effectively in a range of different scenarios and overcome language barriers between fellow international students. The ability to communicate well is an attractive skill for employers and it is one of the most important skills gained from studying abroad.

You will also improve other aspects of your communication skills, including presenting and public speaking, negotiating, academic writing and non-verbal communication.

2. **Learning a new language**

If you are planning on studying  abroad in a country in which the native language is not your own, then you will be able to learn a new language in an immersive environment. While studying a language in class can be rewarding, applying it in real-world situations can give you an entirely different perspective. Socializing with other international students, talking to your lecturers and learning and developing your reading and writing are the perfect way to enhance a second language.

Complete immersion into another language often proves the fastest way for students to learn, and through conversations with native speakers, you will be able to pick up accents, colloquialisms and idioms.

Students with key language skills are highly desirable to employers, especially those fluent in two or more languages - even more so in ever-internationalizing industries.

3. **Global connections**

Studying in an international environment will give you the opportunity to make lifelong friends and connections from an array of different backgrounds. You will meet students from across the world meaning you can create a global network of contacts.

The opportunity to diversify and interact with students, who will go on to work in a wealth of different international industries, allows you to create a worldwide contact base that comes with a number of advantages that can help you throughout life and your career.

Maintaining connections with people from around the world can be a great way to help achieve your long-term career goals and you will also get to experience a range of cultures and customs.

4. **Project management**

The ability to plan and organize your time becomes even more important when in a new environment abroad. Not only will you be learning a new language or developing your language skills, you will have to adapt to a new culture and lifestyle.

You will also be navigating and embracing your new home. You will be getting used to international transport, new currency, mobile phone contracts and your university coursework. This means you will develop the ability to plan logically and think critically - key skills of project management and key skills that employers typically look out for.

5. **Boost your confidence**

Overcoming the challenges that studying abroad presents, will lead to you becoming a more mature person, thriving in new circumstances and improving your self-reliance. The improvement of other skills such as language, communication, adapting to unexpected situations and leadership will also help you to be more confident. International study abroad will show employers that you have the confidence and bravery to go abroad to a foreign country, learn a new language, culture and lifestyle and have the passion to study for a degree.

1. **Gather Documents**

You will realize that studying abroad involves lots of documents, papers, and applications. For that reason, you should be well organized when it comes to gathering them.

First of all, you need to have a passport, a valid one, to travel anywhere in the world. If you do, that’s great! If not, you will have to contact your local embassy and ask them for information on how to apply for one.

Depending on the country that you’re traveling to, you might also need a student visa to enter. Usually, the process isn’t that complicated as you will find very specific details on the official websites of each country.

2. **Research the Destination**

Before leaving, take the time to do some research about the people and their culture, and any problems that the country is experiencing that may affect your travel plans.

Understanding the culture, inquiring about the food, looking at maps and areas, and practicing the language are all things that can make you feel more comfortable and less anxious.

When you arrive there, you might still be confused and experience unexpected things, but inquiring will help you minimize this shock.

3. **Arrange Accommodations**

Getting accepted into a university is perfect, but now you need to think about where you will live abroad. To decide, you have to understand the differences between living off-campus and on-campus.

This decision will be mainly owned by personal preferences. Some students agree that living off-campus has more freedom as you won't be restricted by any curfews/laws, you will live alone, become more independent, and get to choose the location of the house. However, this expensive option transportation to be more with higher rent costs. It is also harder to make friends and find roommates.

4. **Visit a Doctor**

Getting your bachelor’s degree abroad typically means that you will be out of your home country for 4 years, more or less. That’s not a short time, and this is why you should visit a doctor to do blood work, check-up exams, and other needed procedures to avoid complications in the new country.

5. **Prepare Yourself Mentally**

International students face several mental challenges when studying abroad such as homesickness, cultural shock, loneliness, and anxiety, but what’s important is that you know how to deal with them!

Instead of doubting the idea of studying abroad or giving up, you will have to work on yourself to strengthen your personality and be flexible and ready to deal with any challenges along the way.

If you are looking for **an appropriate course to study abroad on a budget**, you can take a while to discover a range of programs in both mobility and degree that [FPT Education Global](https://international.fpt.edu.vn/) is offering for international students to study in Vietnam at affordable costs.

**This post is THE remedy to fix the above issue. Following these steps will put your DELL G7 7700 in the mandatory CHOKEHOLD it desperately needs. This laptop is like a Ferrari with no brakes, this fix is putting on those brakes.**

1)FIRST

The i7-10750H is a locked CPU, meaning it cannot be undervolted or underclocked. This happened a while ago in some old bios update, but thats not important. What IS important is that it can be UnLocked. This first Step is the most ""difficult"" if you are not familiar with this aspect of computer knowledge, so you will need good ""Follow Instructions"" skills. Follow these steps one by one, take your time, read and re read before moving forward if unsure.

Step 1: Dump a copy of your BIOS.

Download [HWiNFO](https://www.hwinfo.com/download/) to see which version of Intel Manageability Engine your computer is using (it is listed under Motherboard > Intel ME)

https://preview.redd.it/tsndqrs2x3t81.png?width=1435&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=67c8e38d7b4bec3cff319eced3761829e389a1f2

Based on the version of Intel ME you are using, download the proper version of Intel ME System Tools listed [here under header C2.](https://www.win-raid.com/t596f39-Intel-Management-Engine-Drivers-Firmware-amp-System-Tools.html)

\*\*\*\*I downloaded the 14.0.0.20+ r17

Unzip the Intel (CS)ME System Tools folder, and open up a command line or Powershell shell terminal window as an Administrator and navigate to the location of the “Flash Programming Tool” folder in the directory you unzipped, by changing directory with a command like the below:

cd ""C:\\Users\\<username>\\Downloads\\Intel CSME System Tools v14.0.11- r1\\Flash Programming Tool\\WIN64""

Once in the FPT folder, run the below command (different depending on your terminal of choice) to dump your current computer’s BIOS to your PC (**don’t forget the -bios part, and definitely don’t type something other than -d by accident, this tool can be dangerous if used improperly**!):

\# if using cmd.exe (Command Prompt) :

FPTW64.exe -d ""bios\_dump.rom"" -bios

\# if using Powershell :

.\\FPTW64.exe -d ""bios\_dump.rom"" -bios

Step 2. Extract Your System’s Setup Settings with UEFITool

With the above BIOS dump in hand, it is now time to use [UEFITool](https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool) to search for the settings we care about, specifically the Overclocking. Download, extract, and open the [Windows app](https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool/releases/download/A57/UEFITool_NE_A57_win32.zip), and use the tool to open the BIOS dump we generated above (File…Open Image File)

Once the BIOS image is opened, do a search (Ctrl+F) on the **Text** (not Hex Pattern or GUID) for “Overclocking Lock”. You should find one match, within the BIOS section of interest (“Setup”)

https://preview.redd.it/b4w7f3u4x3t81.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c531e9b5164d42c28e89d62c45467db25630c8ff

The Search match will be a child Section of the File we want to extract.

Right click on the parent File that matched your search (e.g., Click the row that has the Text “Setup”) and click “Extract as is.” Save this .ffs file somewhere, we’ll need it for the next step!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q18d3h36x3t81.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cff83a7c792a65e0a8a031b997268d31ef917bb8

Step 3. Get a Human Readable Version of Your BIOS Setup Settings with IFR Extractor

The file we just extracted contains all of the toggle-able options your computer BIOS has, many of which Dell hides by default. We will need one more tool to get a human-readable version of these options, which [is LongSoft’s version of IFR Extractor](https://github.com/LongSoft/Universal-IFR-Extractor/releases/download/v0.3.6/IRFExtractor_0.3.6_win.zip). (Older versions of IFR Extractor do not provide the location of the EFI variables you need to edit, but this one does.) Windows warned me the file might be unsafe, but I had no problems with it; for those who want to do due diligence, the repo/source code is [here.](https://github.com/LongSoft/Universal-IFR-Extractor/tree/v0.3.6))

Simply open IFR Extractor, point it to the .ffs you extracted in Step 2, and click extract. It will prompt you to save a .txt version of the file somewhere. You now a nice, human-readable text file that includes all the possible options you can change. Time to open it!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7zs24gfbx3t81.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2361b411ecc1fc563209ccb38c2c2d913cc32eec

Step 4. Find BIOS Setup Options of Interest

When you open the IFR extracted text file, you’ll see pages and pages of BIOS settings as well as the location of these settings variables (variables are accessed at a given VarOffset within a given VarStore) in your NVRAM. In simpler times, most BIOS options you wanted to edit were conveniently stored in a single Setup VarStore, but now they are spread across multiple VarStores, which makes things trickier.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4eo42nbcx3t81.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=82f7ecc171206a7988abbe2a1d8e8fcc19e2ac5b

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vevzu0scx3t81.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c0bed7714d741d0c3de1820fa13c11b5ceb27e58

**Overclocking Lock** – This option is stored at VarOffset 0xDA within VarStore 0x3. If this variable is set to 0x0, the lock is disabled. If it is set to the default 0x1, it is enabled. A overclocking lock doesn’t just prevent you from making your CPU run faster, it also prevents you from changing your voltages, including undervolting.

**CFG Lock** – This option is stored at VarOffset 0x3E within VarStore 0x3. If this variable is set to 0x0, the lock is disabled. If it is set to the default 0x1, it is enabled. I’m unsure if you need to disable this for undervolting, but I did disable it in case I wanted to try the Hackintosh route in the future.

The VarStore that contains the Overclocking and CFG locks on my dell has VarStoreId 0x3. But we need the VarStore **name**. A Control+F reveals this: VarStoreId 0x3 has the name **CpuSetup**.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1uhomaldx3t81.png?width=1026&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=08204eb387496ac36376df2d31288fecb50878d0

We now know everything we need to move on to the next step:

* Both the Overclocking Lock and CFG Lock options are stored in the CpuSetup VarStore.
* To disable the Overclocking Lock, we need to set VarOffset 0xDA to 0x0 **(replace 0xDA with the VarOffset you see for Overclocking Lock on your own machine, as it may not be the same as mine!)**
* To disable the CFG Lock, we need to set VarOffset 0x3E to 0x0 **(replace 0x3E with the VarOffset for CFG Lock you see on your own machine, as it may not be the same as mine!)**

Step 5. Prepare a EFI USB Boot Drive

We now will prepare a special USB flash drive that will allow us to set the above “lock” variables to 0x0. For readers who have used setup\_var to modify EFI variables before, note that I am using a newer, special version of setup\_var someone made that allows users to modify variables at a specific VarStore name. Using the older, more popular setup\_var command that’s hardcoded to look at the VarStore named Setup won’t work here!

1. Download the grubx64.efi file from v1.0 alpha release available [here](https://github.com/XDleader555/grub_setup_var/releases).
2. Get (or format) a blank FAT32 flash drive.
3. Create a folder called EFI. Within this EFI folder, create a folder called Boot.
4. Place the grubx64.efi folder above into the EFI/Boot folder path.
5. Rename grubx64.efi to bootx64.efi.

You should now have a flash drive with one file, bootx64.efi, located in the path X:/EFI/Boot (where X is your flash drive’s drive letter.) Time to boot it!

Step 6. Disable Secure Boot in BIOS and Boot Prepared EFI USB Drive

Before your computer can boot the EFI flash drive, you will have to disable the Secure Boot option in your BIOS. Then you can access the Boot Menu and select your flash drive to boot into a modified GRUB terminal. You should now have the ability to execute the command “setup\_var” to read and edit settings of interest, which are stored as EFI variables.

Before you attempt to modify the values of our EFI variables, you should check that the variables identified above (Overclocking Lock and CFG Lock) are able to be read and are set to 0x1 as we expect them to be. It is always good to first test reading the variables before writing them!

You can use the setup\_var command along with the VarStore and VarOffset values associated with your BIOS CFG Lock and Overclocking Locks to read their current values:

setup\_var \[VarStore\] \[VarOffset\]

For my Dell this returned my Overclocking Lock value:

setup\_var CpuSetup 0xDA

Step 7. Edit EFI Variables of Interest

After you confirm you can read the CFG Lock and Overclocking Lock EFI variables, you can attempt to change them to a value of 0x0 to disable them with this usage of setup\_var:

setup\_var \[VarStore\] \[VarOffset\] \[Value\]

For my Dell, the following commands disabled my Overclocking Lock and CFG Lock:

setup\_var CpuSetup 0xDA 0x0setup\_var CpuSetup 0x3E 0x0

Once you change the variables, you can simply unplug your flash drive, reboot, re-enable SecureBoot, and boot back into Windows. Everything should seem the same as it was before, except now you can change CPU voltages.

2)SECOND

if you managed to do the first step, please Prevent Dell from taking your undervolt away!

Dells have an option in the BIOS to prevent Windows from automatically updating your firmware, keeping your undervolt safe (but potentially exposing you to security flaws that go unpatched). If you’d rather have undervolting than security fixes, look for the “UEFI Capsule Firmware Updates” setting in your BIOS and turn it OFF. Nice try Dell, but this undervolt is here to stay!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i0zrsqtex3t81.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fc445555f89789f3febab10a1dcbac29100332c6

Disabling UEFI Capsule Firmware Updates in the BIOS will reduce the risk of you losing your undervolt, but also prevent Dell from automatically providing fixes and security patches.

Next) Download QUICKCPU from here [https://coderbag.com/assets/downloads/cpm/currentversion/QuickCpuSetup64.zip](https://coderbag.com/assets/downloads/cpm/currentversion/QuickCpuSetup64.zip) or go to the very bottom of the site and get the newest version

in quick cpu go to advanced CPU settings

under ""turbo limits"" and ratios set turbo long power max to 23w and turbo short power max to 23w

under ""speed Shift"" set maximum allowed performance to 33, minimum allowed performance to 29, and desired performance to 31. Set Max performance to 100%

under FIVR control set cpu core and cpu cache offset to -101.4

create a profile for these settings and edit your profile to only be used if plugged in and if you want, on start up.

also on the quick cpu main page i set my system power plan to balanced.

THIS HAS UNDERCLOCKED AND UNDERVOLTED YOUR CPU for cool temps. you should see 75c during gameplay with max settings fps still satisfyingly high

3)THIRD

Unpark all cores:

hit windows + R and type REGEDIT

run

Click on the “Edit” tab and then click on “Find”. Then copy-paste the following text into the search box **“0cc5b647-c1df-4637-891a-dec35c318583”** (without the quotes). Be sure to check the “Match whole string only” box, and then click “Find Next”

Change the value in the “Value data” box to “0” (zero)

click ok.

(sometimes QuickCpu will park your cores so check this by windows+R after you have made any changes in quickcpu, ensure the value is still zero, if not change it to zero)

4)FOURTH

underVolt GPU

download [MSI Afterburner](https://www.msi.com/page/afterburner) and open the curve editor.

this next bit will be tedious as hell but you have to do it.

there will be a curve, start with the left most square and put it down to 1305. now set each one to 1305 so it is a strait line all the way across. you can also set the first one to 1305 and hit ctrl+L while highlighting the square at 1305, to lock the entire curve at 1305, but mine doesnt work for some reason. so i made a straight line. once done go to the msi user interface on the right and unlock the lock icon by clicking it, hit the save icon down in the center. once the numbers on the right blink, click on it should remain lit. lock the lock. now you have that curve profile saved. double click it a few times to ensure it is set.

you can use an overlay in game using msi afterburner to check cpu and gpu temps mhz wats, i suggest you do. but i wont explain that here.

\*\*\*\*lastly you can download dell power manager to control your fans. if your gonna play a game set your thermal to high performance to blast your fan. you can also set your fan speed with hwinfo that you downloaded info, but the simple way is through dell power manager.

**THESE ARE THE FIXES TO ENSURE THERE WILL BE NO MORE THERMAL ISSUES. LAPTOP WILL STAY COOL AND SO WILL YOUR MOOD. LET ME KNOW WHO THIS HELPS.**

**ALSO IM SURE THIS WILL WORK FOR OTHER MODELS WITH SIMILAR CPU/GPU SET UPS**

**\*MAKE SURE QUICK CPU AND MSI ARE ON AND THE PROPER PROFILES ARE LOADED BEFORE YOU PLAY LOL\*\***"

Universities and colleges provide students with various ways to meet others. You may feel it’s challenging to step outside of your comfort zone and engage with others, but remember, everyone is open-minded and in the same situation. If you need a little push, below are some suggestions on making friends while studying abroad.

&#x200B;

**Join a Club**

This is the perfect opportunity to try something new, discover a new passion and, of course, make some international friends. You may even join a club to maintain your personal interests, such as soccer or music. When it comes to clubs and associations in higher education, the options are truly endless. If you’re unable to find something you want to be part of, why not begin your own club. You’ll find other students with the same interests. Either way, a club is sure to connect you with students of similar interests.

**Attend Social Events**

Schools put on social events of all types, all year round. Typically student clubs set up tables in a common area on campus to advertise any upcoming events. You will also find various flyers and social media postings sponsored by your host school, so you don’t have to worry about missing an event! You may choose to attend alone or perhaps with a new friend. Social events are a simple way to meet other students in a more structured way.

**Engage with Classmates**

It’s easy to meet and get to know your classmates. Professors tend to conduct classroom conversations and assign group projects, so you get a chance to converse with most students. This will ultimately make the environment in the classroom much more enjoyable and exciting.

**Volunteer with the International Office**

Volunteering with your host school’s international office means engaging with both incoming and outgoing international students. This is an opportunity to share your knowledge with students, whether it’s on how to apply, what’s needed to prepare, how to adjust to culture shock, etc. Here is your opportunity to chat and connect and give the student the same guidance you received!

One thing to keep in mind when studying abroad is everyone is in the same boat, meaning all students are in the same situation as you. Be open-minded and take advantage of this. You are sure to connect with some of the most incredible people who may end up being your life-long friends.

If you are looking for an appropriate course to study abroad on a budget, you can take a while to discover a range of programs in both mobility and degree that [FPT Education Global ](https://international.fpt.edu.vn/)is offering for international students to study in Vietnam at affordable costs.

# Valuation, Share price, and financial backing

THCB has been declining due to several factors that I believe in the long term is inconsequential. 

It has going against it that…

1.  The overall market is on a slump.

2. The Tech/EV market is on a slump.

The truth of the matter however is that both markets WILL return. If you spend enough time on Reddit or watch the news you’d think the world is ending. However, I personally believe that we were never in a massive bubble. Maybe the past few weeks but not the past few months or years. The market is efficient and was priced exactly where it should be and everything is now for sale. All working-class American retirement is now tied to the stock market. Not social security, not pensions that are invested in bonds, gold, etc. With QE the US government has made a material change in the risks associated with the stock market. This is in addition to retail investors being at record highs, including increased participation from internationals. While there is a micro-event occurring, the market will eventually bounce to new highs, after high yielding bonds are bought, remaining and additional funds will return to the market. 

In a market correction or “bubble popping”, everything doesn’t just go to zero. What will happen is the “pets.com”’s of SPACs will go to ZERO, and you know EXCATLY which ones are those. That money will get consolidated into solid investments. Selling Microvast now in my opinion would be selling a solid investment that will make you realize any losses that you are going through. It is part of the reason why I never invest in anything I don’t plan on holding for a while. Most startups, concepts, etc. fail. Investing in research projects are almost never a good idea. Microvast was founded years ago by an individual who sold his prior business for 50X ROI. Microvast has survived 2008, survived the pre-tesla anti-EV environment, survived the 2015 China market crash, survived COVID-19, etc. Its reasons for struggling will be explained further below. Going forward the value in Microvast is essentially its vertical integration and currently viable solutions to unresolved issues like this

[https://twitter.com/GUNMTLM3/status/1367607456361193475](https://twitter.com/GUNMTLM3/status/1367607456361193475)

With that being said, a significant amount of money is behind Microvast. In total over $1B has been invested into Microvast by these parties.

**Koch Disruptive Technologies** 

**CITIC Bank**

**Blackrock**

**Oshkosh**

**US Department of Energy**

**Ford**

**GM**

&#x200B;

None of these companies are in the business of losing money (except Ford) and have significantly more information than we do about Microvast and the marketspace. Koch’s disruptive technologies fund spent $3B on SPACs and Microvast was one of only four that they believed have high risk high reward value.

&#x200B;

# Potential Partners

These are potential partners ranked from most likely with sources provided, except in the case of personnel.

&#x200B;

**CNH Industrial**

CNH Industrial is like the John deer of Europe pulling in about $30B in revenue like the likes of Tesla, John deer, etc.. They are owned by the same people who own Ferrari, Fiat, Maserati, Dodge, Chrysler, Alfa Romeo and several other auto manufacturers. Microvast claims that they are running at full capacity and have a backlog of orders. Part of the reasoning for the Germany plant was a letter of intent between CNHI for electrification options of their entire subsidiaries. 

[https://newsroom.jeschenko.de/microvast/](https://newsroom.jeschenko.de/microvast/)

This is their German PR outlet. I translated everything from german to English and lost the files. Unfortunately, I’m NOT doing that again. Use google translate/camera. 

&#x200B;

**Oshkosh**

This is an important partnership because Oshkosh has invested millions into the PIPE funding. They have a financial incentive to increase the value of Microvast through multi-million dollar deals. People have been fixating on the USPS deal, and there are so many DD posts on it so I wont cover that. Oshkosh has several other uses for Microvast. The first is their JLG business which is going full electric. JLG owned by Oshkosh is currently working on a supply deal. Another opportunity is the Oshkosh PowerPulse diesel-electric system. The ROI for these systems is huge. The M1 Abrams gets 2 miles per gallon, the vehicle to transport it, the Oshkosh M-1070 gets less than 1 mile per gallon. Oshkosh came out with the ProPulse system which is forced to use supercapacitors due to the large current demands, but the Microvast LTO would be the next step forward for the PowerPulse system. There have also been rumors of EV dump trucks. 

To speak on USPS and them going full electric. There have been rumors of Oshkosh and insider trading involving the US government and USPS. It could be true or it could be just butthurt Workhorse investors. Either way some congressman have been buying Oshkosh and Ford since their submission date.

I estimate about $1M+ has been invested in Ford and Oshkosh by members of Congress between July the USPS vehicle deadline and today, there is a time delay of reports so there may be more purchases that won't be revealed until several weeks from now. There have been ZERO workhorse purchases. Here are some examples of F/OSK purchases

**Ford**

Again, trying to reduce repetition. This post has more information on Ford. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/lvk44e/summary\_of\_microvasts\_partners\_thcb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/lvk44e/summary_of_microvasts_partners_thcb/)

&#x200B;

What I will add is one, that Ford has came out that they will **NOT** be building their own battery factories. The second being an excerpt, likely from Ford about Microvast in the proxy report:

**“The material is currently being evaluated through a United States Advanced Battery Consortium grant, and the project manager from one of the big three OEMs describes this technology as “the greatest breakthrough in LIB separator technology in 20 years”.**

Source:

[https://insideevs.com/news/442058/ford-doesnt-want-own-battery-factory/](https://insideevs.com/news/442058/ford-doesnt-want-own-battery-factory/)

&#x200B;

**BMW**

BMW is another potential contract. They have been working for years with microvast on a fast-charging protocol. Several of Microvast GmbH engineers are former BMW employees or former Joyson employees which is the BMS provider for BMW (hybrids, i3, i8 etc.). Another profound statement in the DA was:

“In Europe, our primary customers include industry-leading companies such as FPT, the global powertrain brand of CNH Industrial Group, ZF Friedrichshafen AG (ZF Group), Safra, CARGOTEC**, a luxury sport vehicle German OEM**, VDL, TFL and the London Bus Operators (former Wrightbus).”

That really only leaves BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagon / Porsche, and Audi as options. In addition to what was said about CNHI, in an interview with Sascha Kelterborn, they claim that the new factory will be producing the new 330 Wh/kg NMC battery. As per the DA “NMC technology have been third-party evaluated by TUV and various U.S. National Labs, confirming our claims to performance.” In fact, they are one of only two commercial businesses considered to be involved at Argonne CSE. These new NMC cells as per the interview, are designed for the VDA EV standard. The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) is comprised of BMW, Mercedes, and Volkswagon. They are an automobile association setting the standards their suppliers must abide by for their vehicles.

**Daimler (Mercedes Benz, Daimler trucks, etc)** 

Microvast is literally a few yards away from the famous Mercedes Ludwigsfelde factory. 

Ibb.co/RcbmRpV (new factory was built to the right)

This factory manufactures the electric Sprinter van among other vehicles. Daimler is also working on an LTO based trucking platform. There is really only two OEMs to pick for regarding this which is Toshiba SciB or Microvast. The proxy and other filings list BMW by name so Mercedes could also be what is being referred to.

&#x200B;

**Tesla**

This rumor has been around for a while now. It’s largely due to the physical locations of the new Tesla factory as well public discussions between Microvast and tesla on social media. Definitely a reach but the greatest EV producer still has not figured out how to stop their cars from spontaneously catching fire. Now extrapolate this to an EV semi that’s estimated to hold 10-15 tons worth of batteries. Tesla to my knowledge has really not publicly said anything about solving this risk. 

[https://mobile.twitter.com/GUNMTLM3/status/1367607456361193475](https://mobile.twitter.com/GUNMTLM3/status/1367607456361193475)

&#x200B;

**China’s Industrial Mining Industry**

While I put this last, I don’t think its necessarily least likely, more that its an overlooked aspect by retail investors. INHO the largest per vehicle beneficiaries of EV would actually be the autonomous mining industry. Their vehicles all get less than 1 mile per gallon. Millions in fuel is spent per year literally on just fuel costs for a single dump truck in a single open pit mine. High draw of battery power is a negligible factor if done right, as the sheer weight of these machines recharges them to the point of infinite range. While mining has been growing worldwide, I put china here because they are seeing an explosion in automated mining and they have the greatest chance of skipping technological generations and having their new massive mines adopt EV transport equipment.

# Technology

Looking at the marketcap of a lot of EV companies, technology is obviously where the eyes are (which is not without reason). Below is the summary of Microvast’s tech and how it holds up to the competition.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6x4wsrbv9jm61.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc494b9575a59c6baeb45bede6f98f6f24c08262

&#x200B;

**Future technology**

Based on research conducted at Argon National lab, patents filed, and trademarks filed, microvast publications, I’ve been led to believe that Microvast will be releasing a battery of this type within a year from now, from most likely to least likely.

**Lithium – Silicon, Silicon-Carbide:** From the proxy statement on R&D, “In the coming years we anticipate that we will develop and market **a new product that contains silicon or silicon oxide**.” This is the same route that Tesla is following instead of solid-state batteries. Microvast personnel have several publications on this topic. 

**Solid State:** Has already been covered extensively. A part of the 476 Microvast patents.

**Lithium – Sulfur:** Following the pattern of Microvast’s naming convention the elemental symbol for S is Sulfur. This would be pretty big, bigger than solid state, if it turns out to be the true. Specific energy would be over 2,600 Wh/Kg. Microvast personnel have prior research experience on this subject. 

**Sodium Ion Battery for large scale energy storage:** The symbol for Sodium is Na not S so the trademark may not necessarily make sense at its face, but they could be also referring to **So**dium. Several publications including ones co-authored by Microvast and Argonne refer to this battery type as S-ion batteries instead of Na-ion batteries. If this being the next battery chemistry is true, this is also a big deal because large scale energy storage is likely not going to be what Tesla or Stem are doing. It is going to be a different low cost highly abundant chemistry like sodium ion batteries. 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-ion\_battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-ion_battery). The “**Smartery**” trademark might be the equivalent of what Stem inc and others are doing in terms of smart distribution of power. Microvast’s future may be including the battery management into the vertical integration process. From the proxy document: “Our R&D efforts are focused on the following areas:… we are developing control strategies and other systems to manage grid-scale energy storage units.” Lastly they had a older PowerPoint I found floating around that they were investigating sodium ion batteries. Unfortunately, I can no longer find it.

# Lock up period

This is one of the most important details when it comes to SPAC mergers. Lockups will signify if the stock is a pump and dump scheme or is a legitimate operation with ongoing efforts to increase shareholder stake values (and subsequently their own equity) which improves investor confidence. The SPAC standard as of late has been that PIPE investors have essentially ZERO to 30 days of lockup before they can start selling. This has screwed people up multiple times on this sub (HYLN, NKLA, GEOV, etc). As soon as the resale registration is filed, they can start selling. For the merging companies the typical lockup is ZERO to 6 months. Below are the lockup details for microvast

**PIPE:**  Tuscan will have to provide the PIPE 6,736,111 shares (from convertible notes) + 48,250,000 shares = 55 million shares (included within the 300M shares) which equates to approximately 18% ownership of Microvast as depicted in the DA presentation. Lockup period is 6 months regardless of market conditions. However, a form S-8 will be filed immediately after merger to lockup 5% of total shares for employee incentives. If there was any uncertainty with this DD its here. Id personally be on the lockout for registrant filings post-merger. They aren’t necessarily bad as some markets on some stocks will eat those up, but its best to stay vigilant   

**Yang Wu (Microvast CEO):** 12 Month 25% lock-up unless MVST is trading over $15 for over 20 days. His other remaining 75% of holdings are subject to a 24 Month lockup regardless of market conditions. Wu has a sizable (but not unheard-of) ownership of Microvast at 31% (85M shares) at MOST he can sell 25M shares. He has zero salary or stock options so his financial future is solely dependent on MVST’s share price. 

**Everyone else:** 6 Months regardless of market conditions. 

I don’t think these terms are abusive, they are slightly better than average but not as good as the proposed lockups they had in a previous proxy so this is a heads up. There have been some material changes between the two. From what I can remember the previous Wu lockup condition was $18 over 30days vs $15 over 20, Non-Wu shareholders locked up was 12 months. So, they probably felt that things were cooling down between the draft of that agreement and the new terms months later. I don’t find this shady at all. Microvast and Tuscan have done a good job detailing out every single way Microvast can playout, and performing audits. 

&#x200B;

# Common misconceptions

These are some false information I’ve seen involving Microvast.

&#x200B;

**“There are 750M outstanding shares”**

Outstanding shares is 300M not 750M. The 750M value is the AUTHORIZED shares which is just a limitless number that’s needed for regulatory reasons. It determines the MAX amount of shares they can legally ever issue. Typically, corporations will have multiple times more authorized shares than they have outstanding shares.

&#x200B;

**“Ashmore considered Microvast “worthless.””**

While they were not necessarily satisfied with the appreciation of Microvast since investing years ago they did see increases in value up until late 2018-2020 where debt (which has now been resolved) was greater than assets. So, ON PAPER Microvast was “worthless” but not really (like a lot of other companies with debt-to-equity ratios < 1). In fact, based on filings Ashmore has increased their position and will own almost 10% of Microvast. Most of the concerns in their summaries was hypotheticals and not current business conditions. 

&#x200B;

**“Microvast isn’t a startup they’ve been around since 2006”**

While this is true, Tesla and co literally have been around since the early 2000s (Tesla (2006), Lucid (2007), Aptera (2005), Rivian (2009), Fisker (2007) etc.). There is a reason why all of these started around the same time but that’s a discussion for another day. Microvast suffered for all the reasons why those businesses suffered. Microvast is one of the few survivors of that era and is nothing to be bearish about.

&#x200B;

**“Microvast is a Chinese company”**

This is usually said with negative sentiment. It’s a weird one because companies like NIO, Xpeng, Alibaba, etc are purely Chinese businesses, one of which is a clone of an American product. Considering Microvast's large number of international employees, investors, factories, etc. I’d considerate an international business at this point. It's actually is in a really good position where it is American enough to win US grants and conduct research with US universities, but Chinese enough to have access to the EV boom in China.

[vm.tiktok.com/ZMek1MX5S/](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMek1MX5S/)

&#x200B;

**“ Stanley Whittingham is only there for appearances”** 

Dr. Whittingham is a noble prize winner who still publishes battery research to this day, which includes several publications on Lithium silicon batteries from 2018-2021. He was brought on by Tuscan with Vogel and others to be directors. However, he was also specifically elected by Yang Wu and will continue to stay on board post-merger at minimum for 2 years. Believe it or not he has worked with Microvast research staff prior to this merger. He likely is involved in the lithium-silicon or other battery type development

&#x200B;

The last thing I can say is that the definitive agreement deadline is May 1st. Many users priorly were upset they missed the gap up to $27. This date would likely be the last date to buy in. Trade Safely!

**There are types of dozer and blades** [**used in construction**](https://sellyourconstructionequipment.com/)**. The term “dozer” was first used in the nineteenth century to describe an operational mechanism attached to the front of track-type tractors. It was employed to scatter loose dirt out over the top of the overfill. The types of dozer and blades have evolved through time and is now utilized all around the world to conduct more difficult building operations.**

**How types of dozers and blades have evolved?**

**The dozer was originally referred to as a steel plate and an operational mechanism mounted on the front of track-type tractors. They were affixed to the front end of a pole drawn by horses or oxen and were made of wood. Their major job was to move loose dirt out as it gathered in the overfill. With the passage of time, types of dozers and blades was added to the machine’s front end, which was controlled by a rope windlass attached to the tractor’s mainframe.**

**Manufacturers began developing dozer blades that matched specifications and quality criteria in the mid-1940s. Both cable and hydraulically controlled versions were available. These track-type tractors were rapidly** [**dubbed “dozers**](https://sellyourconstructionequipment.com/)**” and were employed for a variety of projects such as motorways, dams, canals, and so on. For material lifting, cable controls were initially used. Dozers eventually gained an onboard computer that allowed the operator to control the blade and produce a specified design. Modern dozers are employed for activities like moving material and finishing grading, and they’ve evolved over time. A dozer is available in three sizes: small, medium, and giant. There are now a variety of undercarriage, drivetrain, and blade configurations, as well as a slew of other options. The name “dozer” now refers to tough machinery designed for harsher building jobs.**

**In modern Indian construction, different types of dozers and blades are employed.**

**India plans to spend up to 111 trillion rupees on infrastructure projects over the next four years, thanks to the large investment. Bulldozers are now widely used on roads, trains, and airports as a result of this. Bulldozer producers are now concentrating their efforts on technological advancements that will support the machine’s compact variations and features that will improve its performance on difficult terrains. Built-in intelligence is now available, allowing you to seamlessly integrate with leading GPS grade control systems. They are also available in a variety of power and handling configurations. In India, various types of dozers and blades are employed in road, mining, railway, and other** [**construction projects**](https://sellyourconstructionequipment.com/)**.**

**Types of dozers and blades** **come in a variety of shapes and sizes**

**Crawler Dozers**

**The crawler is a tracked dozer with a** [**tractor-like appearance**](https://sellyourconstructionequipment.com/)**. This large equipment is used to transport items from one location to another. A Hydrostatic Transmission System is standard on modern crawler dozers, allowing for variable or intermediate speed choices. The mainframe, which is made up of a track frame and connecting bars, was created using modern Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) technology. Dual-path closed-circuits with two variable displacement piston pumps and two 3-speed variable displacement travel motors are standard on contemporary models. For protection against rocks and stumps and to improve longevity, travel motors and final drives are installed inside the track shoe.**

**The use of large-size links, pins, bushings, and special dust seals considerably extends the life and reliability of the undercarriage. Dynamic brakes are used on dozers to guarantee that they operate safely. Light operating effort and good blade response are provided by the 3-axis PPC valve and ergonomically built joystick. All directional movements are controlled using a PCCS (Palm Command Control System) joystick. The blade is easily visible because of the engine hood and well-placed operator seat. This improved blade visibility improves grading efficiency and eliminates operator guesswork. The models are made to maximize the curvature of the blades. Because of the broad blade radius, the material’s rolling-up performance can be enhanced by using the entire blade. This allows for high production while still retaining grading capabilities.**

 

**Dozers on Wheels**

**This machine, which is also known as a tire dozer, is often larger than a crawler. Wheel dozers have sturdy frames that may last for many years and resist the harshest environments. It has a full box-section rear frame that can withstand torsional and twisting pressures. The installation of the axles has been adjusted to improve structural integrity. The Steering and Transmission Integrated Control System combines directional selection, gear selection, and steering into a single lever on the new models.**

**Powershift transmission is consistent thanks to the Advanced Productivity Electronic Control System’s integrated electronic controls. Fuel-saving features include a mechanically operated electronic unit-injection system, engine-idle-shutdown and engine-idle kick-down systems, delayed-engine-shutdown system, and on-demand and hydraulically powered cooling fan on the latest wheel dozers. Automatic temperature control, touch-screen display with soft keypad, electro/hydraulic parking brake, and the Comfort III seat with air-ride suspension and inbuilt controls are all available in the operator cab.**

**Miniature bulldozers**

**A tiny dozer, sometimes known as a mini dozer, is used for activities that demand more mobility and flexibility than larger equipment. Technology advancements and a new low-emission, fuel-efficient engine are among the features of today’s tiny dozers. It has a redesigned lower sloping hood line that increases finish grade efficiency by improving vision to the periphery view and the blade’s cutting edge. The models had blade capacities ranging from 1.85 to 1.98 cubic metres, 92 horsepower, and operational weights ranging from 8,319 to 8,627 kg. These machines’ Eco mode allows the engine to automatically offer maximum speed and power until the load lowers.**

**A 25-cm primary display with color touchscreen and access to many of the standard and optional advanced technology features is also included in the new model. By supplying the chassis in the cross-slope direction, the slope Assist feature in compact dozers enhances operator efficiency when operating on slopes. This also works in tandem with the operator’s blade control input, making it easier, faster, and with less effort to complete the grade.**

**Dozers that are hybrids**

**These types of dozers and blades feature electrical components and have a blade combination that can work in both soggy and difficult terrains. The current generation of hybrid dozers excels in load responsiveness, maximum torque, power, and fuel efficiency. The turbocharged engine with an Air-to-Air intercooler uses well-proven multi-injection technology to improve torque back-up and fuel efficiency while lowering engine noise and vibrations. The common rail FPT Industrial engine’s hydrostatic transmission provides best-in-class pulling capacity and controllability. The radiators in the new models are positioned without overlap, allowing each radiator to get fresh air and maintain stable fluid temperatures.**

**The hydrostatic fan adjusts its speed in real time to match the actual cooling need, lowering power consumption. The reverse mode decreases the amount of maintenance required and extends the time between cleanings. For great machine controllability and faster cycle times, the driver can modify all of the working parameters. The cab controls provide a variety of electronic settings and automatic tasks to assist the driver.**

 

**Dozer Blades of Various Types**

**The blades used in the aforementioned types can be further categorised. Varied blades have different functions, can handle various materials, and can bear a variety of load weights.**

* **Straight Blades (S-Blade) –** **This is the smallest** [**blade dozer**](https://sellyourconstructionequipment.com/) **with no surface wings. In the bottom back corners of the blade, this blade connects to the arm.**
* **U-Blade (Universal Blade) —** **This blade has lengthy edges and a curved design, making it suitable for transferring material to longer parts. It’s useful for transporting commodities across vast distances. It’s the tallest and widest blade kind, and it works well with mild to medium-density soil.**
* **S-U (SEMI-U) Blade —** **This blade combines the S-blade with the U-blade to offer adequate penetration. It’s perfect for moving soil over great distances.**
* **Angle Blade – This blade is mounted to the bulldozer’s panel in the middle. Because it can tilt close to 30 degrees left or right, it’s for shifting garbage to the side.**
* **Power-Angle-Tilt (PAT) Blade —** **This blade can tilt at any angle in practically all directions. It can be controlled from the cabin. Scraping, land clearing, leveling, backfilling, and grading are all tasks that it is employed for.**

**Conclusion**

**The many** [**varieties of dozers** ](https://sellyourconstructionequipment.com/)**and the characteristics provided by manufacturers to propel the need for multi-terrain in India are described above. In order to improve the quality of the work,** [**the construction sector** ](https://sellyourconstructionequipment.com/)**has a high rate of adoption of technologically advanced equipment. Significant investment in rail infrastructure, highway building, and metro rail projects, as well as government housing programs, are expected to drive demand for dozers in India.**

I need someone here now!""",2018-05-17 06:34:45,"LTL, FPT, XYZ, LMNOP...This ended up being longer than I expected. Hopefully it's entertaining enough to be worth it.


TL;DR, Always get it in writing.


I work for an events office at a university running a Campus/Student Center as well as several other satellite event locations, and part of that job includes providing tech support for meetings. Everything from setting up mics and projectors to video conferencing to basic windows troubleshooting and everything in between. I've got tons of stories from that, but I'm going to start with this one as another story here reminded me of it. (Details and timeline fudged to keep stuff anonymous.)


A couple winters back the university was going through it's re-accreditation process. For those unfamiliar with the processes the tl;dr version is it's a **Big Deal** and all the higher ups are involved including the $Chancellor's Chief of Staff (CCoS). The accreditation can affect everything from a school's grants, state, and federal funding to students applying to said university ability to get financial aid. 


We'd been leading up to this meeting for weeks. There would be a site visit with the folks from the accreditation board where they would tour the campus, meet some students at the Student Center, some official, some ""spontaneous."" The whole thing would kick off at 8 am with a conference call to other sister campuses. Everyone was completely on edge about this meeting and I was looking forward to seeing the tail end of it.


The day before the meeting it starts snowing. And it snows. And snows. *And snows.* We're talking record breaking levels here. We ended up getting dismissed from work early. The President of the University and the Vice Chancellor of HR send out the ""Don't come to work tomorrow unless you are essential personnel"" email. The Governor issues a state of emergency and says everyone except emergency vehicles should stay off the roads. I tuck in for the night content in the knowledge that my son and I will get to have a great day at home having snowball fights and building snow caves.


Well, the next morning rolls around and I wake up to my work cell ringing. I have a strict ""off-hours"" policy so I put my work cell on Do Not Disturb mode from 12 am-6 am. I've got something like 20 missed calls and texts. But now the $CCoS is calling my personal cell. I don't even know how he got my personal cell number as I only ever gave that number to my work wife. Something very bad is happening.


$me: Hello?


$CCoS: Where the *$%@ are you? Why is the Campus Center closed! Where is everyone? The accreditation officers will be here in an hour! We need to get everything up and running!


*Where do you think I am you moron? There's two feet of snow outside.*


$me: I'm at home. The Campus is closed. The governor has issued a state of emergency. I'm not allowed out on the roads.


$CCoS: I don't care! These accreditation officers are only in town today so we are going to go through with this meeting. I need the building unlocked and the conference equipment running! And we need those students that are supposed to be part of the tour.


*you serious? Half my staff are commuters. I'm not going to risk their safety and make them come in. And the ones that do live on campus, I'm not going to make them come in either, you f-ing nut job, I'd have to pay them extra to get them to come in.*


$me: Well, the video conferencing system is plug and play, and I can get facilities to clear the sidewalk but they'll probably charge extra, and I can probably get campus security to come in and unlock the building and staff the front desk, but that's another cost. As for staffing, I cannot make it in, there's two feet of snow outside my house, and a good portion of my students commute so I can't ask them to come in either as I can't ask them to risk their safety. What I can do is ask if anyone who lives on campus is willing to volunteer to come in. But that's an extra charge. And I can't promise they will want to come in.


$CCoS: Just make it happen! This is a critical meeting and **everything** has to be perfect. *Do whatever it takes to make this happen.*


$me: *Foreseeing a trap* Alright. But I'm going to need this in writing. Can you please send it to me in an email?


$CCoS: Yes. Fine. Whatever. *click*


Two minutes later, sure enough, I get an email from him. *""The Accreditation Meeting is going forward as planned. The Center needs to be open by 8am. Pull whatever resources you need to make this happen.""*


Armed with those magic words I went to work. Being in events, you have to make quick friends with Security and Facilities (and IT), so I got on the horn with both departments and acknowledged that I'd have to pay extra to get them focused on the Student Center, but I let them know that the $CCoS made it very clear that I had to get this done no matter what. Yes, there's an extra emergency charge, plus the 4 hour minimums, but we have to make it happen. Yes, I will also send this in an email so you are covered. Then I find a couple of my student staff who live in the dorms close by that were willing to come through the storm for a little extra emergency pay.


The event went off without a hitch, but the $CCoS was not happy when he got his giant bill afterwards. Fortunately, since I had just sent the bill in reply to his ""Make this happen at all costs"" email, I was in the clear."

Highlights from S-1
Energy Efficiency and Alternative Propulsion.    We believe the rise of alternative propulsion solutions (ranging from biogas propulsion to battery and fuel cell electric) and corresponding environmental regulatory changes will force companies to rework their existing products and fleets to utilize alternative propulsion methods. Likewise, as the cost of generating energy from alternative sources continues to come down and become more comparable to other power generation methods, power systems will continue to evolve, driving the need for new investments in equipment, software and services. This will create a large market opportunity for a new alternative propulsion ecosystem consisting of suppliers and OEMs developing and distributing these alternative technologies and end customers who will incorporate these new propulsion systems into their products. Companies who participate in developing enabling technologies will be longer term beneficiaries by achieving accelerated growth potential across the changing energy cycle.  We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 13, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aldebaran Resources Inc. (“ **Aldebaran** ” or the “ **Company** ”) is pleased to report assays from the final two holes completed in the 2020/2021 campaign at the Altar copper-gold project located in San Juan, Argentina. The highlights are listed below, with corresponding images in Figures 1-3 and detailed results in Table 1.

**Highlights**

* QDM-21-42 was collared in the QDM/Radio area of the Altar project (see Figure 1), and returned 111 m of 1.4% CuEq, within 333.1 m of 0.86% CuEq, also within 629 m of 0.61% CuEq.
* QDM-21-42 intersected a high-grade porphyry (Radio Porphyry), returning one of the best holes drilled to date at Altar.
* The current resource estimate at Altar does not include mineralization from Radio Porphyry, and thus the intercept in QDM-21-42 is entirely outside the current resource estimate.
* ALD-21-219 was collared at Altar Central (see Figure 1) and drilled into a previously untested area, returned 487 m of 0.33% CuEq and 178 m of 0.31% CuEq.
* The top 735 metres of ALD-21-219 is within the current Altar resource pit where there was limited previous drilling and should add resources in the next resource estimate update.
* At a depth of 740 m, ALD-21-219 intersected a previously undiscovered porphyry unit that is intensely altered and has disseminated chalcopyrite and bornite mineralization. The hole was drilled along the edge of a promising surface geochemical target which will require follow up drilling in future field seasons.
* All holes from the 2020/2021 field season have now been reported.

**John Black, Chief Executive Officer of Aldebaran, commented as follows:** *“QDM-21-42 represents one of the best holes drilled on the project to date and opens a large area to be drill tested in the next field season. While there is already a significant resource at Altar, we view the discovery of this high-grade zone in Radio Porphyry as transformative for the project, especially considering none of this mineralization is currently in the resource. Radio Porphyry will clearly be one of the priority targets in our next field season which will be much larger in scale.”*

**Dr. Kevin B. Heather, Chief Geological Officer of Aldebaran, commented as follows:** *“QDM-21-042 confirms our belief that the Radio Porphyry area offers excellent potential to discover high-grade copper and gold mineralization with minimal arsenic content, which was one of the reasons we were originally attracted to the Altar project. We are currently evaluating these extremely exciting results in relation to our recently completed 3D IP-MT geophysical survey results, and strongly believe that we have only tested a small portion of the prospective target area. ALD-21-219 is also encouraging as it is drilled into a previously untested area, so intercepting a long run of low- to medium-grade copper mineralization within a new porphyry phase suggests we could be on the edge of another new porphyry system.”*

**Discussion of Results:**

**Drill Hole QDM-21-42** was drilled at an azimuth of 306 degrees and dip of -80 degrees to a final depth of 1,047.0 m (see Figure 2). The hole was targeting a geophysical magnetic-high anomaly, as well as testing for the southern extension of higher-grade mineralized intercepts from historical drilling into the Radio Porphyry. The top 818 m of the hole intersected andesite wall rocks, which are typically favourable host rocks for copper-gold mineralization, and diorite porphyry intrusion from 818 m until the end of the hole. From the top of the hole, the andesites are strongly altered and contained abundant quartz veins with sulphides +/- magnetite, all of which are increasing in intensity until the contact with the Radio diorite porphyry at 818 m. Quartz veining, as well as sulphide content (consisting of chalcopyrite and bornite), are at their maximum intensity near the contact between the andesite wall rocks and the diorite porphyry intrusion. Alteration, mineralization, and quartz veining continue within the porphyry.

**Drill Hole ALD-21-219** was drilled at an azimuth of 026 degrees and dip of -74 degrees to a final depth of 1,164.5 m (see Figure 3). The hole was collared towards the southeast edge of Altar Central and was targeting a geophysical magnetic-high anomaly, which was believed to be a deep magnetite bearing porphyry unit. As well, it tested the northwest edge of a promising surface talus fines geochemical anomaly. The top 299 m of the hole intersected rhyolite host rocks, portions of which were oxidized. From 299 m to 740 m, the hole stayed in rhyolite host rocks which displayed localized high-sulphidation mineralization consisting of pyrite and enargite. Arsenic was elevated in the areas where high-sulphidation mineralization was observed in the hole due to presence of enargite. From 740 m to the end of the hole, a new diorite porphyry phase was intercepted, which locally had intense alteration and displayed disseminated mineralization throughout consisting of chalcopyrite, bornite and locally magnetite.

Table 1 below provides more detail on the mineralized intercepts encountered in drill holes QDM-21-42 and ALD-21-219. The locations of the reported drill holes are indicated in Figure 1.

**About Aldebaran Resources Inc.**

Aldebaran is a mineral exploration company that was spun out of Regulus Resources Inc. in 2018 and has the same core management team. Aldebaran acquired the Rio Grande copper-gold project located in Salta Province, Argentina from Regulus along with several other early-stage projects in Argentina. Aldebaran also has the right to earn up to an 80% interest in the Altar copper-gold project in San Juan Province, Argentina from Sibanye Stillwater Limited. The Altar project hosts multiple porphyry copper-gold deposits with potential for additional discoveries. Altar forms part of a cluster of world-class porphyry copper deposits which includes Los Pelambres (Antofagasta Minerals), El Pachon (Glencore), and Los Azules (McEwen Mining). A total of 259 drill holes (119,052 m) have been completed at Altar between 1995 and 2019. In March 2021 the Company announced an updated mineral resource estimate for Altar, prepared by Independent Mining Consultants Inc. and based on the drilling completed up to and including 2020. Aldebaran’s primary focus is the Altar project with a view to discovering new zones with higher-grade mineralization.

**Sampling and Analytical Procedures**

Altar follows systematic and rigorous sampling and analytical protocols which meet and exceed industry standards. These protocols are summarized below and are available on the Aldebaran website at [www.aldebaranresources.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4qj3kbKgrrDGGwFPt_cK-h51H_Tp4W4mhIAgok2VK3q3JFexDsVcEKBbbgoTW2lwQYY21ZmFg-jtXNBSAgoPOAgzIQcN9Zq0WTfAy_oh1U5Dtc04bU7w_zS341CcPpiH) . All drill holes are diamond core holes with PQ, HQ or NQ core diameters. Drill core is collected at the drill site where recovery and RQD (Rock Quality Designation) measurements are taken before the core is photographed and geological quick log produced. The core is then transported to the Altar camp facilities where the core is photographed again under more optimum lighting conditions and then the core is cut in half with a diamond saw blade, with half the sample retained in the core box for future reference and the other half placed into a pre-labelled plastic bag, sealed with a plastic zip tie, and identified with a unique sample number. The core is typically sampled over a systematic 1 to 2 metre sample intervals unless the geologist determines the presence of an important geological contact, which should not be crossed. The bagged samples are then stored in a secure area pending shipment to a certified ALS laboratory sample preparation facility located in Mendoza, Argentina, where the samples are dried, crushed, and pulverized. The resulting sample pulps are sent by batch to the ALS laboratory in Lima for geochemical assay analysis, including a fire assay – AA finish analysis for gold and a full multi-acid digestion with ICP-AES analysis for other elements. Samples with results that exceed maximum detection values for gold are re-analyzed by fire assay with a gravimetric finish and other elements of interest are re-analyzed using precise ore-grade ICP analytical techniques. Aldebaran independently inserts certified control standards, coarse field blanks, and duplicates into the sample stream to monitor data quality. These standards are inserted “blindly” to the laboratory in the sample sequence prior to departure from the Aldebaran facilities.

148,https://www.reddit.com/r/equipmentbuyandsell/comments/ui0pov/various_types_of_dozer_and_blades_equipment/,Various Types of Dozer and Blades | Equipment Planet Equipment,2022-05-04 13:58:53," **There are types of dozer and blades** [**used in construction**](https://sellyourconstructionequipment.com/)**. The term “dozer” was first used in the nineteenth century to describe an operational mechanism attached to the front of track-type tractors. It was employed to scatter loose dirt out over the top of the overfill. The types of dozer and blades have evolved through time and is now utilized all around the world to conduct more difficult building operations.**

**How types of dozers and blades have evolved?**

**The dozer was originally referred to as a steel plate and an operational mechanism mounted on the front of track-type tractors. They were affixed to the front end of a pole drawn by horses or oxen and were made of wood. Their major job was to move loose dirt out as it gathered in the overfill. With the passage of time, types of dozers and blades was added to the machine’s front end, which was controlled by a rope windlass attached to the tractor’s mainframe.**

**Manufacturers began developing dozer blades that matched specifications and quality criteria in the mid-1940s. Both cable and hydraulically controlled versions were available. These track-type tractors were rapidly** [**dubbed “dozers**](https://sellyourconstructionequipment.com/)**” and were employed for a variety of projects such as motorways, dams, canals, and so on. For material lifting, cable controls were initially used. Dozers eventually gained an onboard computer that allowed the operator to control the blade and produce a specified design. Modern dozers are employed for activities like moving material and finishing grading, and they’ve evolved over time. A dozer is available in three sizes: small, medium, and giant. There are now a variety of undercarriage, drivetrain, and blade configurations, as well as a slew of other options. The name “dozer” now refers to tough machinery designed for harsher building jobs.**

**In modern Indian construction, different types of dozers and blades are employed.**

**India plans to spend up to 111 trillion rupees on infrastructure projects over the next four years, thanks to the large investment. Bulldozers are now widely used on roads, trains, and airports as a result of this. Bulldozer producers are now concentrating their efforts on technological advancements that will support the machine’s compact variations and features that will improve its performance on difficult terrains. Built-in intelligence is now available, allowing you to seamlessly integrate with leading GPS grade control systems. They are also available in a variety of power and handling configurations. In India, various types of dozers and blades are employed in road, mining, railway, and other** [**construction projects**](https://sellyourconstructionequipment.com/)**.**

**Types of dozers and blades** **come in a variety of shapes and sizes**

**Crawler Dozers**

**The crawler is a tracked dozer with a** [**tractor-like appearance**](https://sellyourconstructionequipment.com/)**. This large equipment is used to transport items from one location to another. A Hydrostatic Transmission System is standard on modern crawler dozers, allowing for variable or intermediate speed choices. The mainframe, which is made up of a track frame and connecting bars, was created using modern Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) technology. Dual-path closed-circuits with two variable displacement piston pumps and two 3-speed variable displacement travel motors are standard on contemporary models. For protection against rocks and stumps and to improve longevity, travel motors and final drives are installed inside the track shoe.**

**The use of large-size links, pins, bushings, and special dust seals considerably extends the life and reliability of the undercarriage. Dynamic brakes are used on dozers to guarantee that they operate safely. Light operating effort and good blade response are provided by the 3-axis PPC valve and ergonomically built joystick. All directional movements are controlled using a PCCS (Palm Command Control System) joystick. The blade is easily visible because of the engine hood and well-placed operator seat. This improved blade visibility improves grading efficiency and eliminates operator guesswork. The models are made to maximize the curvature of the blades. Because of the broad blade radius, the material’s rolling-up performance can be enhanced by using the entire blade. This allows for high production while still retaining grading capabilities.**

 

**Dozers on Wheels**

**This machine, which is also known as a tire dozer, is often larger than a crawler. Wheel dozers have sturdy frames that may last for many years and resist the harshest environments. It has a full box-section rear frame that can withstand torsional and twisting pressures. The installation of the axles has been adjusted to improve structural integrity. The Steering and Transmission Integrated Control System combines directional selection, gear selection, and steering into a single lever on the new models.**

**Powershift transmission is consistent thanks to the Advanced Productivity Electronic Control System’s integrated electronic controls. Fuel-saving features include a mechanically operated electronic unit-injection system, engine-idle-shutdown and engine-idle kick-down systems, delayed-engine-shutdown system, and on-demand and hydraulically powered cooling fan on the latest wheel dozers. Automatic temperature control, touch-screen display with soft keypad, electro/hydraulic parking brake, and the Comfort III seat with air-ride suspension and inbuilt controls are all available in the operator cab.**

 

**Miniature bulldozers**

**A tiny dozer, sometimes known as a mini dozer, is used for activities that demand more mobility and flexibility than larger equipment. Technology advancements and a new low-emission, fuel-efficient engine are among the features of today’s tiny dozers. It has a redesigned lower sloping hood line that increases finish grade efficiency by improving vision to the periphery view and the blade’s cutting edge. The models had blade capacities ranging from 1.85 to 1.98 cubic metres, 92 horsepower, and operational weights ranging from 8,319 to 8,627 kg. These machines’ Eco mode allows the engine to automatically offer maximum speed and power until the load lowers.**

**A 25-cm primary display with color touchscreen and access to many of the standard and optional advanced technology features is also included in the new model. By supplying the chassis in the cross-slope direction, the slope Assist feature in compact dozers enhances operator efficiency when operating on slopes. This also works in tandem with the operator’s blade control input, making it easier, faster, and with less effort to complete the grade.**

**Dozers that are hybrids**

**These types of dozers and blades feature electrical components and have a blade combination that can work in both soggy and difficult terrains. The current generation of hybrid dozers excels in load responsiveness, maximum torque, power, and fuel efficiency. The turbocharged engine with an Air-to-Air intercooler uses well-proven multi-injection technology to improve torque back-up and fuel efficiency while lowering engine noise and vibrations. The common rail FPT Industrial engine’s hydrostatic transmission provides best-in-class pulling capacity and controllability. The radiators in the new models are positioned without overlap, allowing each radiator to get fresh air and maintain stable fluid temperatures.**

**The hydrostatic fan adjusts its speed in real time to match the actual cooling need, lowering power consumption. The reverse mode decreases the amount of maintenance required and extends the time between cleanings. For great machine controllability and faster cycle times, the driver can modify all of the working parameters. The cab controls provide a variety of electronic settings and automatic tasks to assist the driver.**

**Dozer Blades of Various Types**

**The blades used in the aforementioned types can be further categorised. Varied blades have different functions, can handle various materials, and can bear a variety of load weights.**

* **Straight Blades (S-Blade) –** **This is the smallest** [**blade dozer**](https://sellyourconstructionequipment.com/) **with no surface wings. In the bottom back corners of the blade, this blade connects to the arm.**
* **U-Blade (Universal Blade) —** **This blade has lengthy edges and a curved design, making it suitable for transferring material to longer parts. It’s useful for transporting commodities across vast distances. It’s the tallest and widest blade kind, and it works well with mild to medium-density soil.**
* **S-U (SEMI-U) Blade —** **This blade combines the S-blade with the U-blade to offer adequate penetration. It’s perfect for moving soil over great distances.**
* **Angle Blade – This blade is mounted to the bulldozer’s panel in the middle. Because it can tilt close to 30 degrees left or right, it’s for shifting garbage to the side.**

It was employed to scatter loose dirt out over the top of the overfill. It has evolved through time and is now utilized worldwide to conduct more difficult building operations.

Do you know how [Dozers](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) have evolved?

The dozer was initially referred to as a steel plate, and an operational mechanism mounted on the front of [track-type tractors](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/). They were affixed to the front end of a pole drawn by horses or oxen and were made of wood. Their main job was to move loose dirt out as it gathered in the overfill. Over time, a dozer blade was added to the machine's front end, controlled by a rope windlass attached to the tractor's mainframe. Manufacturers began developing dozer blades that matched specifications and quality criteria in the mid-1940s. Both cable and hydraulically controlled versions were available. These [track-type tractors](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) were rapidly dubbed ""[dozers](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/)"" and were employed for a variety of projects such as motorways, dams, canals, and so on. For material lifting, cable controls were initially used. [Dozers](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) eventually gained an onboard computer that allowed the operator to control the blade and produce a specified design. Modern dozers are employed for moving material and finishing grading, and they've evolved over time. A [dozer](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) is available in three sizes: small, medium, and giant. There are now a variety of undercarriage, drivetrain, and blade configurations, as well as a slew of other options. The name ""dozer"" now refers to formidable [machinery](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) designed for harsher building jobs.

In modern Indian [construction](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/), different [types of dozers](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) and blades are employed.

Thanks to the large investment, India plans to spend up to 111 trillion rupees on infrastructure projects over the next four years. [Bulldozers](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) are now widely used on roads, trains, and airports as a result of this. [Bulldozer](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) producers are now concentrating their efforts on technological advancements that will support the machine's compact variations and features that will improve its performance on difficult terrains. Built-in intelligence is now available, allowing you to seamlessly integrate with leading GPS grade control systems. They were also available in a variety of power and handling configurations. In India, various [types of dozers](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) are employed in road, [mining](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/), [railway](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/), and other [construction](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) projects.

Dozers come in a variety of shapes and sizes.

[Crawler Dozers](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) (Crawler Dozers)

The crawler is a [tracked dozer](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) with a tractor-like appearance. This [large equipment](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) is used to transport items from one location to another. A Hydrostatic Transmission System is standard on [modern crawler dozers](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/), allowing for variable or intermediate speed choices. The mainframe, which is made up of a track frame and connecting bars, was created using modern Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) technology. Dual-path closed-circuits with two variable displacement piston pumps and two 3-speed variable displacement travel motors are standard on contemporary models for protection against rocks and stumps. To improve longevity, travel motors and final drives are installed inside the track shoe. The use of large-size links, pins, bushings and special dust seals considerably extends the life and reliability of the undercarriage. Dynamic brakes are used on dozers to guarantee that they operate safely. Light operating effort and good blade response are provided by the 3-axis PPC valve and ergonomically built joystick. All directional movements are controlled using a PCCS (Palm Command Control System) joystick. The blade is easily visible because to the engine hood and well-placed operator seat. This improved blade visibility improves grading efficiency and eliminates operator guesswork. The models are made to maximize the curvature of the blades. Because of the broad blade radius, the material's rolling-up performance can be enhanced by using the entire blade. This allows for high production while still retaining grading capabilities.

[Dozers on Wheels](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/)

This machine, which is also known as a [tire dozer](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/), is often larger than a crawler. [Wheel dozers](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) have sturdy frames that may last for many years and resist the harshest environments. It has a full box-section rear frame that can withstand torsional and twisting pressures. The installation of the axles has been adjusted to improve structural integrity. The Steering and Transmission Integrated Control System combines directional selection, gear selection, and steering into a single lever on the new models. Powershift transmission is consistent thanks to the Advanced Productivity Electronic Control System's integrated electronic controls. Fuel-saving features include a mechanically operated electronic unit-injection system, engine-idle-shutdown and engine-idle kick-down systems, delayed-engine-shutdown system, and on-demand and hydraulically powered cooling fan on the latest [wheel dozers](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/). Automatic temperature control, touch-screen display with soft keypad, electro/hydraulic parking brake, and the Comfort III seat with air-ride suspension and inbuilt controls are all available in the operator cab.

[Miniature bulldozers](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/)

A [tiny dozer](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/), sometimes known as a [mini dozer](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/), is used for activities that demand more mobility and flexibility than [larger equipment](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/). Technology advancements and a new low-emission, fuel-efficient engine are among the features of today's tiny dozers. It has a redesigned lower sloping hood line that increases finish grade efficiency by improving vision to the periphery view and the blade's cutting edge. The models had blade capacities ranging from 1.85 to 1.98 cubic meters, 92 horsepower, and operational weights ranging from 8,319 to 8,627 kg. These machines' Eco mode allows the engine to automatically offer maximum speed and power until the load lowers. A 25-cm primary display with a color touchscreen and access to many of the standard and optional advanced technology features is also included in the new model. By supplying the chassis in the cross-slope direction, the slope Assist feature in compact dozers enhances operator efficiency when operating on slopes. This also works in tandem with the operator's blade control input, making it easier, faster, and with less effort to complete the grade.​

**Dozers that are hybrids**

These [dozers feature](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) electrical components and have a blade combination that can work in both soggy and difficult terrains. The current generation of hybrid dozers excels in load responsiveness, maximum torque, power, and fuel efficiency. The turbocharged engine with an Air-to-Air intercooler uses well-proven multi-injection technology to improve torque back-up and fuel efficiency while lowering engine noise and vibrations. The common rail FPT Industrial engine's hydrostatic transmission provides best-in-class pulling capacity and controllability. The radiators in the new models are positioned without overlap, allowing each radiator to get fresh air and maintain stable fluid temperatures. The hydrostatic fan adjusts its speed in real-time to match the actual cooling need, lowering power consumption. The reverse mode decreases the amount of maintenance required and extends the time between cleanings. For great machine controllability and faster cycle times, the driver can modify all of the working parameters. The cab controls provide a variety of electronic settings and automatic tasks to assist the driver.

Dozer Blades of Various Types

The blades used in the aforementioned dozer types can be further categorized. Varied blades have different functions, can handle various materials and can bear a variety of load weights.

* Straight Blades (S-Blade) -This is the smallest blade dozer with no surface wings; it is assigned to the module's bottom rear corners. In the bottom back corners of the blade, this blade connects to the arm.
* U-Blade (Universal Blade) - This blade has lengthy edges and a curved design, making it suitable for transferring material to longer parts. It's useful for transporting commodities across vast distances. It's the tallest and widest blade kind, and it works well with mild to medium-density soil.
* S-U (SEMI-U) Blade - This blade combines the S-blade with the U-blade to offer adequate penetration. It's perfect for moving soil over great distances.
* Angle Blade - This blade is mounted to the bulldozer's panel in the middle. Because it can tilt close to 30 degrees left or right, it's for shifting garbage to the side.
* Power-Angle-Tilt (PAT) Blade - This blade can tilt at any angle in practically all directions and can be controlled from the cabin. Scraping, land clearing, leveling, backfilling, and grading are all tasks that it is employed for.

Conclusion

The many [varieties of dozers](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) and the characteristics provided by manufacturers to propel the need for multi-terrain in India are described above. In order to improve the quality of the work, the [construction](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) sector has a high rate of adoption of technologically [advanced equipment](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/). Significant investment in [rail infrastructure](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/), [highway building](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/), and metro rail projects, as well as government housing programs, are expected to drive demand for [dozers](https://interstateheavyequipment.com/) in India.

152,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrc/comments/pt804s/coin_review_mercurial_finance_mer/,COIN REVIEW - Mercurial Finance (MER),2021-09-22 20:53:04,"**TỔNG QUAN VỀ DỰ ÁN MERCURIAL FINANCE VÀ ĐỒNG COIN MER**

**I/ Mercurial Finance là gì?**

* Mercurial là một sàn giao dịch phi tập trung (DEX) kết hợp với quỹ đầu tư tự động phi tập trung (Vault) được xây dựng trên hệ sinh thái Solana.

&#x200B;

**II/ Sự khác biệt của Mercurial Finance so với các nền tảng DEX khác (như Uniswap,...) là gì?**

* ***Giảm thiểu trượt giá khi swap tokens, đặc biệt là các stable tokens:***
   * Nguyên lý:
      * Thay đổi công thức bonding curve: thêm hệ số khuếch đại a nhằm giảm trượt giá (slippage) nhưng đổi lại thì mức giá cho phép sẽ bị giới hạn
      * Cân chỉnh a cho các thể loại cặp token khác nhau: (1) Cặp tokens được neo giá theo tỷ lệ 1:1 (ví dụ: USDT/USDC, hoặc wBTC/renBTC,...); (2) Cặp tokens giao động trong khoảng hẹp (ví dụ: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY,...); (3) Cặp tokens giao động tự do (ví dụ: ETH/USDT, SOL/ETH,...)
   * Điều này khác biệt so với bonding curve truyền thống của Uniswap x\*y = k:
      * Cho phép khoảng giá không giới hạn (nếu token X bị mua quá nhiều thì giá của X niêm yết bởi Y sẽ tiệm cận dương vô cực)
      * Tuy nhiên, bonding curve đơn giản này gặp phải một vấn đề đó là trượt giá mạnh và không tối ưu cho từng thể loại cặp token khác nhau như trên

&#x200B;

* ***Phí giao dịch linh hoạt theo điều kiện thị trường để gia tăng lợi nhuận cho các nhà cung cấp thanh khoản (LP):***
   * Khi thị trường ổn đinh: phí giao dịch thấp để thu hút nhiều khối lượng: lợi nhuận của LP đến chủ yếu từ khối lượng giao dịch
   * Khi thị trường biến động mạnh: phí giao dịch cao để tối ưu lợi nhuận (vì lúc đó nhu cầu giao dịch tăng) - giống như hiện tượng spread gia tăng khi thị trường biến động mạnh trên các sàn giao dịch tập trung
   * Việc đo lường mức độ biến động của thị trường được thực hiện bằng việc theo dõi tỷ lệ giữa trung bình động của khối lượng giao dịch trong ngắn hạn và dài hạn --> không nhất thiết phải sử dụng Oracle mà có thể hoàn toàn dùng dữ liệu on-chain
   * Đây là điểm ưu việt hơn so với cơ chế phí cố định của Uniswap và nhiều sàn AMM hiện tại

&#x200B;

* ***Sử dụng nguồn vốn trong quỹ thanh khoản để đầu tư nhằm tối ưu hoá lợi nhuận và giảm thiểu tác động của Impermanent Loss đối với các nhà cung cấp thanh khoản (LP):***
   * Việc phân bổ vốn vào nền tảng nào để thu lợi nhuận (yield) sẽ được DAO quyết định
   * Một số ý tưởng: flash loans, gửi vào các nền tảng lending, các vaults (quỹ đầu tư) khác,...

&#x200B;

* **Ngoài ra, hiện nay Mercurial Finance đã được liên kết với Serum nhằm chia sẻ thanh khoản với nền tảng order-book DEX này (xem thêm trong bài phân tích về Serum)**

A win is 1 point, a lose is -1. After a week everyone below 2900 drops down to Gold3. There are 14500 points if we add up all five's points. Simple.

**Day 1, Monday (after reset).**

* The Whale beat all four now has 2904 points and a big d\*\*k.
* The Veteran beat the FTP, the Dolphin and the Casual but got rekt by the Whale. Now has 2902 points. (3 win is 3 points a lose is -1)
* The FTP beat the Doplhin and the Casual, but lost to the Veteran and the Whale. Now has 2900 points.
* The Dolphin f\*\*\*d the Casual but got molested by its superiors. Now has 2898 points.
* The Casual lost all his matches. That is **you** who rant on reddit all the time. You have 2896 points.
* **Total points 14500.**

**Day 2, Tuesday**

Matches with the same result for simplicity.

* Whale 2908
* Veteran 2904 (started from 2902 got 3 points that is 2905 lost one 2904)
* FTP 2900
* Dolphin 2896
* Casual 2892
* **Total points 14500.**

**Day 7, Now let magic happen and skip to next Monday before reset.**

* Whale finished with 2928 points. He is happy.
* Veteran has 2914 points. He is happy.
* FPT has 2900. He shat his pants but survived.
* Dolphin has 2886 points. He is sad he got demoted.
* Casual has 2872 points. That is you getting demoted. Git gud.
* **Total points 14500.**

**Conclusion**

The problem is not what you think but the **finite number of arena points**. I know this is not my idea. Well it is a fact but not mine. BUT ALL THE F\*\*\*\*G TIME PEOPLE BULLS\*\*TRANT FOR THE WRONG F\*\*\*\*G REASON. **The strong FARMS the weak...** wins a s\*\*ttons of matches collecting a s\*\*ttons of points from the weak. And how the weak suppose to stay above 2900 points? My simple example showed only 2 player drop from five but it more. A LOT MORE. The number of players who can stay in Gold4 is not static is not like 3v3 where you have given number of slots in each tier. The strong steals a lot of points even from the relatively strong and even the relatively strong can drop down to Gold3. The bots poured additional points into the pool. Random points. So even your sorry ass had a chance to farm points and stay above 2900 points but now that bots are gone it's ""the strongest dog f\*\*\*s"".

The problem is that the weak cannot develop fast, cannot progress fast. There is a huge ass wall now to get Arbiter and to be able to develop great hall. **I would eliminate tier related missions. I would eliminate all the bonuses for tiers and would introduce an universal medal system with 1 medal type and each tier wins would provide equal amount of medals.** So everyone could enjoy arena on their level. There could be nice matches in Silver II. You would not NEED to climb only for your own ego so you can show everyone that you are among the top dogs now.

Inactive players on low tiers are a problem I do not wish to talk about now.

Everything about the Finite Number of Arena Points is something Plarium is well aware of. It is not something they can solve without financial setbacks.

Edit: Please read Wystix's post (link in the comments) that has a more detailed argument on the issue. Mine was just a simple example so even the simple would get (hopefully) as it seems the vast majority of the reddit community rants for the wrong reason."

Executive Team
Mr. Hubertus Muehlhaeuser

Most recently, Mr. Muehlhaeuser was the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director of CNH Industrial NV (“CNH”), which generated revenue of $28 billion in 2019. Mr. Muehlhaeuser helped to strategically reposition CNH by announcing the separation of the company’s on-highway business (IVECO and FPT) from the core off-highway business (Case, New Holland, Steyr) and by focusing on growth and enhancements to the product and technology portfolio while delivering meaningful efficiencies and profit margin improvement. During his tenure, CNH completed seven acquisitions and partnerships with an eye towards identifying and investing in key disruptive technologies and trends impacting the company’s core end markets and products. These next-gen industrial and technology investments included CNH’s strategic growth equity investment in Nikola in September 2019, an EV truck designer and manufacturer, and CNH’s acquisition of AgDNA, a precision agriculture technology company.
Prior to CNH, Mr. Muehlhaeuser was the President & Chief Executive Officer of Welbilt, helping the company successfully complete its spin-off from Manitowoc in March 2016 and acquire and successfully integrate Crem, a leading coffee machine maker. Under Mr. Muehlhaeuser’s leadership, Welbilt improved its adjusted EBITDA margins between 2015 and 2017 by approximately 460 basis points to 19.1%, and generated 80% shareholder returns during his tenure. Prior to Welbilt, Mr. Muehlhaeuser served as Senior Vice President and General Manager of AGCO, during which time he contributed to the firm’s nearly doubling of revenue and tripling in market capitalization.

Likewise, as the cost of generating energy from alternative sources continues to come down and become more comparable to other power generation methods, power systems will continue to evolve, driving the need for new investments in equipment, software and services. This will create a large market opportunity for a new alternative propulsion ecosystem consisting of suppliers and OEMs developing and distributing these alternative technologies and end customers who will incorporate these new propulsion systems into their products. Companies who participate in developing enabling technologies will be longer term beneficiaries by achieving accelerated growth potential across the changing energy cycle.  We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view."

**Basic Info:** The Great Lakes Avengers (AKA The Lightning Rods, The Great Lakes X-Men, The Great Lakes Defenders, The Great Lakes Initiative) are the 616 mid-west's premier super team! They came together because of a want-ad in a newspaper and have been protecting the greater Milwaukee area ever since. They've saved the world, saved the universe, saved Detroit, and even saved Christmas twice! The core team consists of Mr. Immortal, Big Bertha, Doorman, and Flatman. Different members have been on and off the team over the years, but this respect thread will only cover core members. The team is presented mostly as a joke... but they get the job done! (Not Included: Hawkeye, Mockingbird, Grasshopper I, II, III, & IV, Leather Boy, Squirrel Girl and associated squirrels, and Deadpool. These people either have way more feats when they aren't on the team or died/quit after an issue or in some cases a single panel.)

##**[Mr. Immortal](https://www.superherodb.com/pictures2/portraits/11/050/10794.jpg?v=1490021982)**

Craig Hollis, AKA Mr. Immortal, is the founder and leader of the Great Lakes Avengers. As his name implies, he's immortal. He dies all the time, but never stays dead. He's an honest hero with some serious emotional issues, and he's probably had more on panel deaths than just about anyone I can think of.

DeMarr Davis, AKA Doorman, is a very powerful, though limited, teleporter who joined the Great Lakes Avengers to make a positive change in the world. DeMarr can teleport to any location that happens to be in the next room over. He sacrificed himself to save the universe and was reincarnated as a servant of Oblivion, collecting the souls of the passed for Death. He isn't super good or dedicated to his job as Deathurge, so he still makes lots of time for the GLA.

##**[Dinah Soar](https://www.writeups.org/wp-content/uploads/Dinah-Soar-Marvel-Comics-Great-Lakes-b.jpg)**


Dinah Soar was a founding member of the Great Lakes Avengers. She's some sort of pterodactyl person (alien?) whose origin is never expounded upon. Her voice can only be heard by the one being she decides to bond with, and that person was Mr. Immortal. The two were in love and dating before she died while fighting Maelstrom. Her beautiful voice is gone, but her memory lives on.

Goodness Silva, AKA Good Boy, is the most recent person to join the Great Lakes Avengers. She's a Detroit native who recently lost her home to a super villain attack that also seriously injured her brother. She, like everyone in her family, has the ability to become her fursona, which for her is a giant blue male wolfman. I don't know if she'll be a permanent fixture on the team, but seemed fair to include her.

The Great Lakes Avengers are truly Marvel's least respected team. Someone has to take care of crises in the Midwest that aren't big enough for real Avengers to be called in! These guys actually have a solid team, but are held back by lack of drive, lack of opportunity, and generally quiet location. I can't wait for their next appearance, but it's ok if it isn't for a while, Mr. Immortal has to show up at least once before the end of the universe! Let me know if you see any issues or whatever with the thread!"

157,https://www.reddit.com/r/touhou/comments/7bnqkl/list_of_unofficial_fanmade_touhou_anime/,List of unofficial / fan-made Touhou anime,2017-11-09 02:30:47,"Hi ! I've been meaning to do that for a little while.

Why did you guys first get into Touhou ? I don't know about you, but for me, it wasn't for the games. I do like hard games, but it certainly wasn't what made me interested in the first place. And even if I already knew that Touhou music was well-known for how good it was, it still wasn't my main motivation for getting into the series.

What intrigued me was the universe of Touhou, the world of Touhou, the lore of Touhou. Gensokyo and its inhabitants. Although developing the story has never been a priority, it spawned an incredibly fascinating dream world, and gave birth to one of the most dedicated fandoms in the world. I knew a bit about the setting, but I wanted to experience for myself the phenomenon that became so loved in the 15 last years.

So that's what I did, last year. I finally got bored enough to [start playing the games](https://www.reddit.com/r/touhou/comments/5ypyop/my_first_impressions_after_starting_immersing/), [reading the books](https://www.reddit.com/r/touhou/comments/5zeuke/more_first_impressions_from_me_eight_books_later/), and [get my hand on every bit of official content I could find](https://www.reddit.com/r/touhou/comments/617eg0/first_impressions_about_the_games_and_books_final/). And it was satisfying ! But now that I was ""into it"", it wasn't enough.

Before being a Touhou fan, I am an anime fan. I'll take a wild guess and assume that I'm not the only one in this community... Anime, as a media, can and has been incredibly powerful in the way it tells a story, including but not limited to by enhancing the immersion with high-quality visuals and music. So, of course, I was hoping to find out that there were official anime adaptations of Touhou out there, especially since the setting of Gensokyo seemed to offer so many possibilities. Surely, now that I knew this world, I was going to live something even more amazing by seeing it come to life in animation. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered that ZUN explicitly refused to produce a Touhou anime.

I then turned to fan-made content. Even if they were not canon or official in any way, it could still bring me entertainment or even touch my feelings. And luckily, as I mentioned, this fandom is famous for being incredibly talented and prolific, to the point where it actually produced a few anime episodes. Which I've watched as fast as I could. Some of them were extremely good, and some of them were not, but even those were still anime episodes, with an atmosphere that made me feel closer to Gensokyo.

Now that I'm pretty much caught up with everything and that I know a bit more about Touhou and its community, I noticed something (or rather, I had already noticed when I was searching for fan-made content). It's actually a bit difficult to find information on Touhou fan-made anime. You have to search around quite a lot, find subtitled videos, and sometimes the information you get is not up to date... It would be a lot easier if there existed a list of Touhou anime and videos to check out, but as far as I know, it's not a thing.

... Yet ! That's what I'm doing right now, as you all already know because of the title of the post (spoilers). To help newcomers find the same feeling that I once found, I compiled a list of every piece of Touhou anime that I could unearth. Now, in addition to the big series that most fans know, there are also a lot of little independant animated videos floating around on the Internet, so I allowed myself to restrict a bit what counted as ""anime"" in my mind.

Therefore, this list does NOT include :

* 3D / MMD videos. Some of them are absolutely hilarious but it's not what I'm searching for here.
* Animations with a style that's too different from anime / manga style. Sorry, I'm biased.
* Parodies that trace or are heavily based upon an existing anime video. I saw a couple anime openings like that.
* Anime videos that are essentially slideshows or with minimal animation.
* Anime videos that are just of insufficient quality. I know it's arbitrary and depends on the viewer but I feel like it really breaks the immersion. Please don't take that as a lack of respect for hard-working fans !

I apologize if you were searching for these kinds of animated videos. I'm not planning to make a separate list for those but I'd be interested to see your recommendations if you do !

Now, onto the list. I'll first talk about the main anime series that exist (you probably have already heard of most of them), and then I'll list a bunch of little anime videos that I found.

#Bonus : some personal recommendations for non-anime stuff

These are just a couple of personal recommendations regarding non-anime videos. Unfortunately, I can't list everyone's favorites (I mean, I could, but that would go far beyond the scope of what I was trying to accomplish with this post), so please don't attack me if your ""must-watch"" isn't included here.

&nbsp;

* **Music video : Bad Apple**

If you haven't seen Bad Apple yet, congrats on getting an Internet connection after ten years spent in an isolated cave. This black-and-white music video is many westerners' first contact with Touhou (... that, and [McRoll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ssh71hePR8Q)), and it became so iconic that dozens of variations have been done with different visuals.

I'm going to share two of them : the [**original one**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8), and the [**English cover by Cristina Vee**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG-Fs7de_9o) that I really like.

&nbsp;

* **2D animation : Diamond in the Rough**

I said earlier that the lack of animation or different styles might break the immersion, but there are exceptions. This one is done in a minimalistic comic style that I didn't know about but later learned was known as [Walfas](http://www.walfas.org/). At the time I started watching it, I didn't think I would be able to take it very seriously, and yet I can now confidently say Diamond in the Rough is the most incredible experience I've had among all the works presented in this list.

Diamond in the Rough is a deconstruction of the ""Gappy Stu"" Touhou fanfics (works of fiction where a young character is gapped into Gensokyo by Yukari and devolves into shallow wish-fulfillment). We follow the adventures of Brolli Diamondback, a bored teenager who gets gapped with the promise of living a more interesting life. I don't want to say more, but I urge you to watch it. [**Here's the playlist**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFB8509F85B1DA408).

And if you have watched it, and you're interested in a detailed analysis of the whole thing, including episode-by-episode breakdown and literary discussions, check out [The Definitive Guide To DitR](https://spaztique.deviantart.com/art/The-Definitive-Guide-To-DitR-Part-1-Background-470282801) written by the author. I spent like two hours reading it the other day and I found it absolutely captivating.

&nbsp;

* **Doujin : Touhou Osana Reimu - Touhou Reireimu**

An original doujin converted to a video series. It explores the relationship between Reimu, her mother, and Rumia, in a surprisingly powerful story. [**You can watch it here**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlsYeCqA-Vc5_XARqSiUMwU2RQ9cYc2Jd).

And that should cover about everything ! I hope you find this list helpful. Hopefully the layout is fine, but if you have any suggestion about the presentation or if you think I should add any other information, I'd be happy to receive your feedback.

If you would like to help me, please let me know of any information that's incorrect, inaccurate, or outdated. If you find an anime video that's not on this list, feel free to post it in the comments. It's possible that I just missed it, or it may be that I saw it but didn't feel it satisfied the criteria I mentioned at the beginning of the list.

Have fun !"
158,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/czzu16/cmv_we_need_to_stop_arguing_about_whether/,CMV: We need to stop arguing about whether abortion is moral and/or should be legal in the US.,2019-09-05 18:58:56,"1. If you believe abortion murder, don’t have one. 
2. Most anti-choice people don’t believe that all women who have abortions should be charged with murder and put in prison which means on some level they admit it should be legal. Can you imagine a scenario where you could hire someone to kill your kid and you weren’t charged, only the hit man was? No? Because the law still recognizes murder-for-hire
3. Most anti-choice want exceptions for rape or incest which means on some level they admit it’s not murder.  Can you imagine a scenario where a woman is raped by a family friend and a few weeks after she kills his 2 year old kid without charges? No? Because intentional murder has no exceptions
4. Most anti-choice have notions about choosing to have sex and thereby choosing to be pregnant which equates to consequences. if they’re only actual objection to abortion is about choice and consequences then they’d increase access to birth control and sex education programs which have both been proven to statistically decrease abortions. Could you imagine requiring a married woman to have as many kids as she can? No? Because we don’t live in the 1800’s anymore where the average was 7-8 kids per family and even married people now control their number of children through birth control. 
5. Most anti-choice want women to carry unwanted, unplanned fetuses to term because it’s a human life that has value. Could you imagine attributing that same zeal to the value of actual children? No? Because we don’t! That’s the problem, which is the most anti-life thing of all. If they actually care about life, then they’d do something about all the death and despair happening to the American children already born. 

Instead of abortion- We should be arguing about the morality of children living in poverty levels not able to meet their basic needs, homeless children, the growing number of kids in foster care and the soaring infant mortality rates. We should be arguing about how to expand access to birth control. 

There are 72.4 million children under age 18 years in the United States. 41 percent of those children live in low-income families. Above low income is defined as at or above 200% of the federal poverty threshold (FPT). Research suggests that, on average, families need an income equal to about two times the federal poverty threshold to meet their most basic needs.
[children in poverty](http://www.nccp.org/publications/pub_1194.html)

A staggering 2.5 million children are now homeless each year in America. This historic high represents one in every 30 children in the United States.
[homeless children ](https://www.air.org/center/national-center-family-homelessness)

On any given day, there are nearly 443,000 children in foster care in the United States.
In 2017, more than 690,000 children spent time in U.S. foster care.
[children in foster care ](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/afcarsreport25.pdf)

More than 23,000 American infants died in 2014, or about 6 for every 1,000 live births, putting us on par with countries like Serbia and Malaysia. Most other developed countries -- as geographically diverse as Japan, Finland, Australia and Israel -- have lower rates, closer to 2 or 3 deaths out of every 1,000. Premature births are the biggest factor in explaining the United States' high infant mortality rate. The major issue of the lack of universal access to quality prenatal care should also be considered in any discussion of preterm births and infant mortality.
Perhaps not surprisingly, babies born to wealthier and better educated parents in the United States tended to fare about as well as infants born in European countries. On the other hand, those babies born to mothers in the United States without these advantages were more likely to die than any other group, even similarly disadvantaged populations in the other countries.
[infant mortality ](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/10/161013103132.htm)

A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that abortion rates are down across the board and suggests that people are able to more effectively plan their reproductive futures. Yet, the Trump administration has finalized a regressive set of health insurance policy changes that could roll back access to the very thing that has helped us get here: birth control.
[birth control](https://www.self.com/story/abortion-rates-birth-control-trump-administration)

TLDR: Anti-choice don’t actually want abortion to be illegal because they have rape / incest exceptions and don’t want to imprison women who’ve had an abortion. Arguing the morality of abortions is unproductive and not helpful in achieving the goal of valuing life or decreasing abortions. Instead we should be arguing about the morality of millions of children in poverty or homelessness and limited access to birth control. 

So change my view and tell me why it’s productive or beneficial to continuing to discuss the morality and legality of abortions in America."

War Robots Remastered is a full-scale technical rework of War Robots client. Models and textures, visual effects, interface and game mechanics — everything went through a major technical rework, resulting in a best looking, most stable and and least phone-heating-battery-consuming War Robots experience you ever had. That is our goal with the remaster! At the beginning, there are going to be two visual presets. As more options will be introduced later on, we'll begin with these: one is for best fidelity, another is for highest performance.

Tomorrow you will experience the performance preset that is better looking than classic War Robots, yet runs miles better.

Test server will be open on April 28-29th from 7PM in the following timezones: GMT/UTC (Universal Time Coordinated), EST (Eastern Standard Time), PT (Pacific Time).

Please spare a little time to complete the feedback form. You can find the form in the test app News section.

We're looking forward to your feedback!WR team

161,https://www.reddit.com/r/Winkerpack/comments/hd7zdt/wall_street_breakfast_the_week_ahead_i_read_this/,Wall Street Breakfast: The Week Ahead. I read this and thought it interesting. Enjoy from SeekingAlpha,2020-06-21 21:39:01,"Nike (NYSE:NKE) will headline a light roster of earnings reports in the week ahead, while Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) WWDC event sets the stage for the company's launch of the first 5G iPhones later this year. On the economic front, reports on existing home sales, jobless claims, consumer spending and a Q1 GDP revision will be the headliners. Fed heads are out in force next week, with virtual speeches on the docket for Raphael Bostic, James Bullard and Charles Evans. In a sign of normalcy, Ford (NYSE:F) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) are expected to return to pre-pandemic production levels at U.S. plants, while results of Fed stress tests on major banks will be announced on June 25.

Earnings spotlight: IHS Market (NYSE:INFO) on June 23; BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), KB Home (NYSE:KBH) and National Beverage (NASDAQ:FIZZ) on June 24; Nike (NKE), Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI), Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) on June 25.

IPO watch: U.S. grocery store operator Albertsons (ACI) is expected to price its IPO next week and begin to trade. The company could have a valuation of over $10B if the IPO prices at the midpoint of the expected range of $18 to $20 range. Albertsons, which is looking to raise as much as $2B, is one of the grocery chains seeing a sales boom in business during the coronavirus pandemic. Stakeholders Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM) and Cerberus Capital are both selling off shares in the offering. No other IPOs are due to price during the week.

M&A tidbits: The walk date for the Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR)-Eldorado Resorts (NASDAQ:ERI) merger arrives on June 24, although no surprises are anticipated. Shareholders vote on the Provident Financial (NYSE:PFS)-SB One Bancorp (NASDAQ:SBBX) deal on June 25. On the same date, Delphi Technologies (NYSE:DLPH) shareholders vote on the merger with BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA). It is almost a lock that there will be some more drama in the Taubman Centers (NYSE:TCO)-Simon Property (NYSE:SPG) duel.

Projected dividend changes (quarterly): Kroger (NYSE:KR) to $0.17 from $0.16, John Wiley (NYSE:JW.A) to $0.35 from $0.34, Saul Centers (NYSE:BFS) to $0.27 from $0.53.

Spotlight on Nike: Nike will post its FQ4 report with more uncertainty in the air than almost any time before due to the lack of formal guidance from the company. The two biggest pullouts from the report are likely to be the pace of recovery in China and the momentum of the e-commerce business. Nike is one of the companies seen by Wall Street as in a strong position on the other side of the pandemic. ""We see Nike as favorably positioned for both secular fitness/casualization trends and industry structural changes that benefit those with strong direct engagement with consumers,"" notes bullish-leaning Wells Fargo ahead of the print. Stocks that quite often move right along with Nike on earnings day include Foot Locker (NYSE:FL), adidas (OTCQX:ADDYY), Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) and Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS).

WWDC: Apple will hold its annual developers conference on June 22-26 in a virtual format this year. Apple is expected to announce its ARM-based Macs as the company advances its control of chips and architecture away from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Enhancements with iOS14, tvOS 14 and watchOS 7 are also anticipated, along with new products/R&D initiatives on the AR headset and wearables/AirPods front. Tim Cook will give the keynote presentation on June 22 at 10:00 Pacific time in what is likely to be his last presentation before the annual September iPhone reveal event.

Healthcare watch: Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) has an investor series presentation next week covering its early pipeline/immuno-oncology on June 22 and hematology on June 25. PDUFA dates arrive for Karyopharm Therapeutics' (NASDAQ:KPTI) Xpovio on June 23, Zogenix's (NASDAQ:ZGNX) Fintepla on June 25 and Heron Therapeutics' (NASDAQ:HRTX) HTX-011 on June 26. The big event of the week in the sector is the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Virtual Annual Meeting II running from June 22-24. A large number of potentially market-moving posters and abstracts are due to be released, as well as special sessions on COVID-19 and cancer research. Some of the notable companies due to present include Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), Phio Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:PHIO), Exicure (NASDAQ:OTC:XCUR), Xencor (NASDAQ:XNCR), ESSA Pharma (NASDAQ:EPIX), ImmunoGen (NASDAQ:IMGN), Molecular Templates (NASDAQ:MTEM), Guardant Health (NASDAQ:GH), CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP), Jounce Therapeutics (NASDAQ:JNCE), GlycoMimetics (NASDAQ:GLYC), Seattle Genetics (NASDAQ:SGEN), Provectus Therapeutics (OTC:PVCT), ORIC Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ORIC), Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), aTyr Pharma (NASDAQ:LIFE), TG Therapeutics (NASDAQ:TGTX) and Neoleukin Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NLTX).

Bank tests: The Federal Reserve will release results of the annual bank stress tests on June 25. Fed Vice Chair Randal Quarles noted that the test this year includes running banks up against three possible economic trajectories of varying severity to see how they perform due to the unprecedented uncertainty about the pandemic. The test will see how banks perform against a rapid V-shaped recovery, a slower U-shaped recovery and a rough W-shaped recovery. The test results could factor in to dividend decisions down the road for Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), while Capital One (NYSE:COF) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) are seen being pushed under the scenarios. Traders are making plays based on the results, with a notable amount of bullish options bets being placed on Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Some other bank names to watch when the results roll out are PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), Truist (NYSE:TFC), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY), HSBC North America (NYSE:HSBC), UBS (NYSE:UBS), Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), Barclays (NYSE:BCS), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) and Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN).

Analyst meetings and business updates: Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) will host a fireside chat for the investor community with members of its management team on June 22. The impact of some of the games introduced at EA Play Live 2020 will be discussed. Hewlett Packard Enterprises (NYSE:HPE) is launching the first-ever HPE Discover Virtual Experience on June 23 to showcase the company's pivot to an edge-to-cloud platform-as-a-service company. In the transportation sector, Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) is participating in a Q&A webcast with Cowen on June 23. Also on June 23, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) has an investor call with Morgan Stanley scheduled. Meanwhile, Sanofi is holding a virtual R&D day event on June 23. Bristol-Myers Squibb has an investor event covering immunology and cardiovascular on June 26.

Conferences rundown: The timing looks spot on for the Jefferies Virtual Consumer Conference on June 23-24 with the pandemic shifting shopping habits in the U.S. Companies due to present include Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS), Planet Fitness (NYSE:PLNT), Nu Skin (NYSE:NUS), Freshpet (NYSE:FPT), Murphy USA (NYSE:MUSA), Sysco (NYSE:SYY), Hostess Brands (NASDAQ:TWNK), Shack Shack (NYSE:SHAK) and Jack in the Box (NASDAQ:JACK). In the healthcare sector, the BMO 2020 Prescriptions for Success Healthcare Conference features virtual presentations by Humana (NYSE:HUM), Halozyme (NASDAQ:HALO), Horizon Therapeutics (NASDAQ:HZNP), Apellis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:APLS), Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Replimune (NASDAQ:REPL) on June 23. Other conferences of note include the SVB Leerink CybeRx Series CNS Forum, BMO Chemicals & Packaging Conference, Wells Fargo Bricks to Clicks Digital Conference, Goldman Sachs Leveraged Finance Conference and the Morgan Stanley Zero Trust Architectures Virtual Thematic Conference. On the smaller side of the conference schedule, the mining and metals sectors will be in focus, with John Tumazos Very Independent Research virtual meetings set for June 23-24 on Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM), Western Copper and Gold (NYSEMKT:WRN), KORE Mining (OTCQB:KOREF), Amarillo Gold (OTCQB:AGCBF), Sierra Metals (NYSEMKT:SMTS), Foran Mining (OTC:FMCXF), Wolfden Resources (OTC:WLFFF), Trilogy Metals (NYSEMKT:TMQ) and Adventus Mining (OTCQX:ADVZF).

Ford F-150: Ford has a digital reveal event for the all-new F-150 set for June 25. The Ford team is expected to describe innovative features of the all-new F-150, including the new electrical architecture, a flat-lying passenger sleeper seat and over-the-air updates to key modules controlling vehicle performance and user experiences. The new truck is seen as a critical part of Ford's plan to slash $5B in warranty costs and push the automaker's vehicle connectivity platform. As a profit generator, the F-150 launch later this year will also help restore the company's balance sheet. The all-new Ford F-150 will be discussed by execs in detail during a June 26 conference call with Citi Research.

Deurbanization trade: Expect more talk from analysts next week about which sectors and stocks could benefit if the mega-trend of people and businesses moving out of downtowns of major cities becomes a reality. Jefferies got the ball rolling last week by singling out Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Floor & Decor (NYSE:FND), At Home (NYSE:HOME), Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) and Wayfair (NYSE:W) as retailers that could gain from an uptick in suburban living and more spending on houses than metropolitan apartments. One of the bigger pure plays is Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO), which has racked up a 64% gain over the last 90 days.

RVs: Keep an eye on the RV sector with May shipment numbers due out from the RV Industry Association. Demand is expected to be on the rebound after RV shipments fell 82% in April. Looking ahead, there is a difference in opinion on Wall Street on the outlook for Winnebago (NYSE:WGO), Thor Industries (NYSE:THO), Patrick Industries (NASDAQ:PATK), LCI Industries (NYSE:LCII) and Camping World Holdings (NYSE:CWH). Some firms like SunTrust Robinson Humphrey expect a RV boom as consumers gravitate toward safer vacations, while Bank of America has warned that the high rate of unemployment and salary cuts could keep discretionary spending in check.

Sports betting: Time is running out for the California Assembly to pass legislation on sports betting to move the issue to the November ballot. The bill has to pass through the legislature before June 25 to become an election issue. Why is it a big deal? California is forecast to have the potential for a +$30B sports betting market through sports books placed at tribal casinos, horse racing tracks and satellite wagering facilities. ""California could easily become one of the most productive sports-betting markets in the world,"" observes gaming analyst Chris Grove. Tax revenue from sports betting would also help the Golden State with its budget issues amid the pandemic and economic downturn. Stocks of interest in relations to how sports betting in California plays out include DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), William Hill (OTCPK:WIMHF), MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM), Caesars Entertainment, Fanduel (DUEL), Red Rock Resorts (NASDAQ:RRR), Boyd Gaming (NYSE:BYD) and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN).

Casinos: The Nevada Gaming Commission is meeting on June 25 to likely approve amendments to state regulations that would streamline the process for moving to modern payment methods. The casino industry in general wants to quickly adopt cashless payment transactions on the casino floor due to the risk of handling cash during the coronavirus outbreak. The casino reset could have implications for Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), as well as financial apps from Apple (AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Casino operators like MGM Resorts, Wynn Resorts, Caesars Entertainment and Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) would also welcome the change.

What's not playing: Warner Bros.'s (NYSE:T) feature animated film Scoob! will stream on HBO Max on June 26 after running in a premium video on-demand window. The children's picture was first scheduled for theaters on May 15 before opting for a 48-hour rental PVOD period price of U.S. $19.99. While Scoob! didn't make quite the splash that Trolls World Tour did in the spring when it nabbed $100M in digital sales over three weeks, it's another incremental step away from the traditional studio release format for major studios like Sony (NYSE:SNE), Universal Pictures (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Disney (NYSE:DIS). As for theater chains, auditoriums are likely to operate at 25% to 50% capacity as AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), Cinemark (NYSE:CNK), IMAX (NASDAQ:IMAC), Marcus Entertainment (NYSE:MCS) and Reading International (NASDAQ:RDI) open back up this summer.

Notable annual meetings: Companies with virtual annual meetings set next week include Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings (NASDAQ:OLLI) on June 22, Dave & Buster's Entertainment (NASDAQ:PLAY) on June 23, Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP) on June 24, At Home Group and Tailored Brands (NYSE:TLRD) on June 25.

Barron's mentions: The publication digs out four industrial companies whose stocks are called compelling. Midsize manufacturers RBC Bearings (NASDAQ:ROLL) and Wabtec (NYSE:WAB) join large-caps Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) and Ametek (NYSE:AME) on the short list of economy recovery picks. Of the four, Wabtec trades with the lowest forward PE ratio at 14.2. Brunswick (NYSE:BC) is also singled out this week as an advantageous product-mix shift and rising boat demand are seen helping to drive shares higher. Most of Brunswick's profit is derived from the high-margin Mercury engine business. The rally in tech names hasn't encapsulated the entire sector. Attractive names still trading at less than 4X sales include Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), CACI International (NYSE:CACI), Leidos Holdings (NYSE:LDOS), Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), Amdocs (NASDAQ:DOX), Ciena (NYSE:CIEN), Accenture, MKS Instruments (NASDAQ:MKSI), Intel and F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV). The cover story this week hits on the rising inequality issue in the U.S., noting that it can be a breeding ground for all kinds of concerning things for the market like secular stagnation."

As per usual this week is going to be a good old reflection of the season so far and especially this past week. I think I can fairly say that this has been my favorite week of the season to date. For one my boys pulled out the victory this week with another 100+ point game. [The Browns won a game leading their fan club to a victory](https://media.giphy.com/media/3cZ8QiaJEYOjM6YeU3/giphy.gif) of their own over the outsider. Then [The Big Commissioner in the Sky](https://media.giphy.com/media/9dKVSp245sTde/giphy.gif) fell to the [Almighty Titties](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT39CTxZaSey99hMVa/giphy.gif) ( . )( . ). Clark's Bitch Ass Little team scored the least amount of points this week. Finally Wyatt, well your team just eats so much ass that their faces are [permanently stained brown and green](https://media.giphy.com/media/jQyHHXQ60W93O/giphy.gif). All in all 8 of us won this week and 8 of us lost. Obviously the ones that won are the best teams in the league and the ones that did not win should just give up now. So, lets move on to that individual analysis that we all love so much. I think I am going to put them in an order this week, lets go with Biggest Bitches to Least Bitches.

[Wyatt (Righteous Blount)](https://media.giphy.com/media/127h8dMHnk5H5C/giphy.gif)

God must not see your Blount as a righteous one because your team make me want to carve my eyes out. You might want to get that weed blessed by a priest or even better next week you should fly to Rome and smoke it with the pope. Getting back to the [ass eating team](https://giphy.com/gifs/wtf-daily-lol-man-qIFepMd1Dx0uQ) of yours. Playing Fuck Allen worked this week, but this Powell wannabe is just a fuck head that happened to blow John Harbaugh's before the game last week to get only goal line work. Taking Carson Wentz seems to be working for you a total of 11.2 points in three weeks and in his one game already has more interceptions that Patty Mahomie. Finally, I fucking told you that Tyreek Hill would shove his [big black dick](https://media.giphy.com/media/isMoellaJNzry/giphy.gif) up your ass and I hope you enjoyed it because he did and is coming back for more this entire season.

Still questioning if Terry Cruise has a hairy cock or not before you go ask him to take you in the back and show you what a real man feels like. If you really want to find out I believe your best approach is to listen to Nike ([Even if it rips you in two, Just do it!](https://media.giphy.com/media/AOlZ1L7hGTcbu/giphy.gif)). You may have the worst team in the entire league. I mean you had zero byes and still scored under 80 points. Your bench preformed horrendous except one player. That Shane will no doubly get to when he make fun of us all. Next you still have not given up on Amari Cooper, even when Derek Carr has. But kudos on being the worst team in the league this week it is a very high honor. Not many teams in history have been as bad as yours.

I know you are gonna say [HOW AM I BITCHY?](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/whats-wrong-with-you.gif) I just sit in my own house and kindly diss you guys every now and then. Well let me tell you! A therapist you think I need a therapist, because I pointed out how you feel after losing and how you are going to feel the rest of the season. This is fantasy football not actual football I do not need to question my life decisions and talk to doctors that tell me you have [hit your head really hard](https://media.giphy.com/media/gPPhH9X1NpilW/giphy.gif) and should probably stop playing. I do not need help unlike your team. My son you got lucky this week, because you actually played the only team that is worse than yours this week. Not only that, but you play in the [worst division](https://media.giphy.com/media/cN6lmYtZVWIF2/giphy.gif) in the league allowing you to have a 2 - 1 record. A record I might add that does not reflect how good you team actually is and if it was not for Stafford's first good game of the year your kicker would have been your leading scorer this week. You are just a sad sole, three points from your running backs my tight end did better. I repeat TIGHT END, the lowest scoring position in fantasy football. You cannot even look to your bench for help, because all but two have zeros and the ones that don't either hurt your team even more or add two points. Get your dumb life together or just quit and give me Michael Thomas.

Either way he is so over the hill and he can no longer carry the shitty patriots team to another supper bowl. You also may want to think harder next week when deciding on your starting line up, so that your bench does not out score your starters again next week. I do not know if anyone has filled you in, but we are the [V-Squad](https://media.giphy.com/media/hDKGFuin7lLfW/giphy.gif), meaning the best squad and we strut our power forcing all others to bow at our feet. The V-Squad is relying on you to carry our good name and show the rest of the league why we are the V-Squad. I wish you luck and prosperity outside of our division.

No one and I mean no one, not even Adam or Abigail would make that mistake. You chased the points this week and lost. This makes you the worst team in your division and maybe even close to the bottom of the league. You are truely are our Kevin, flexing your powers as Commish, but overall you just cannot fantasy. I am sorry my man maybe [administration](https://media.giphy.com/media/SwS227jPQRyNy/giphy.gif) is where you belong.

Since the last time I exploded my thoughts all over the universe your team has stepped up. You and your fellow [titties](https://media.giphy.com/media/YiIGgI3QblMwU/giphy.gif) have preformed a clean sweep on the Peters. The take over has begun and much like the [Dicktators](https://media.giphy.com/media/YJRKfq1kcPjs4/giphy.gif) of the world the [Titty Goddesses](https://media.giphy.com/media/69uMPrtEk1ByU/giphy.gif) need to be removed as well. The [titty rain over](https://media.giphy.com/media/XuLC8ohki6fFC/giphy.gif) the best girl to guy ratio division will be brought to an end. I may have to cheer against my own team ([Sad Chiefs](https://media.giphy.com/media/NyNoUuz1BF2yk/giphy.gif)), while I cry my self to sleep for the treachery. But this week your team will not succeed and the [titty roll](https://media.giphy.com/media/28A92fQr8uG6Q/giphy.gif) will be over.

You gave me my first win of the year. Your entire team except Cam Newton and Sammy Watkins showed up [drunk](https://media.giphy.com/media/o6xoGwmBIb32M/giphy.gif) to their games. But on the bright side I am no longer the worst team in the league and I am 2 - 1 in our riveraly game. Plus you did not lose anyone else to injury this week. I did give you that chance to win at Big 12, when I told you exactly who to start. But Noooooo, your drunk ass decided they were better, [so you sipped your beer](https://media.giphy.com/media/h8NdYZJGH1ZRe/giphy.gif) and watched all the people that I told you to start go off. As, your starters sat at the line of scrimmage shot gunning beers. [Get on your knees and beg peasant.](https://media.giphy.com/media/4JOaSVSBUczAY/giphy.gif)

Desean Watson might finally start panning out for you. That along with the possibility of a [LeVeon Bell trade](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aTxzSoib1tMtF8Q/giphy.gif) so that you can pull two starting running backs out of this fiasco. You my man might have stumbled upon a fantasy gold mine. Your future looks very bright. If you could get the rest of your team to preform like Roberts Woods and Watson. You should do your piss poor division proud in the playoffs unlike Clark's terrible performance last year.

[Peter (I Poop Brown and Green)](https://media.giphy.com/media/FJGINyk1gbvNu/giphy.gif)

I noticed there was a little less green in your poop this week. Then you thought it was a good idea to play a Buccaneer Running Back. The team that has [Fitzmagic](https://media.giphy.com/media/12NUbkX6p4xOO4/giphy.gif) and the magic does not bring the running back any skills. You should probably drop Payten Barber to the wavier wire, because after the Buccs have the BELL on their team all he is going to be good for is a Barber. I know you have been considered an outsider for a while now, but you are like 12 times better than the Peter we have here, [so I would say you are the real Peter Now.](https://media.giphy.com/media/gOCvwLSvGLmus/giphy.gif)

I really enjoyed the name change especially since Powell does not give up. He may never produce a lot fantasy wise, but he does produce some magic. Your team will lose at some point this season and I will be there to capitalize on it, but for now you are welcome for my quarter back giving you the win this week. That second rounder on Gronk still is not doing a lot for you. Then HAHAHAHAHAH, [peer pressure](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o8doSBL02IXmqJq9O/giphy.gif) is a bitch isn't it getting negative points from your def when you could have gotten 8. [Peer pressure](https://media.giphy.com/media/bRb8nUQGP3yaQ/giphy.gif) is not your friend and you deserve it for what you did to me in week 2. Other than that you could not get a worse kicker and you have the wrong Broncos receiver. Enjoy 3 - 0, but don't suck to much dick to get to   4 - 0.

You have upped your number of Browns players since last time and if you would like another one, I am willing to trade you David Nijoku for Jordan Reed. Other than that keep riding the Browns as they make their super bowl run this year, because they will take you to the playoffs for the first time in 4 years.

Basically everyone on my team is producing at a regular pace and have been above or just under 100 points every week.

167,https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/5bo5lg/my_strategy_thus_far_immortal_dif/,My strategy thus far (immortal dif),2016-11-08 02:17:13,"Usually I'm the kind of player to wait for post like these, but I've enjoyed some success with this strategy thus far so I figure I'll put it out there to see if helps some of you.

**Disclaimer** 

I've only played 7 games thus far, ranging from prince to immortal (last 3 games on immortal) I play quick speed on small pangea maps. I've only played against the AI and I exclusively go for science victory, mainly because I simply have not had the urge to attempt a cultural victory and I find military victory tedious to manage with 1UPT.  I turn religious victory off and in fact I never even get a religion, untop of being fairly under powered it also makes the AI hate me less which allows me to forge better relationships with them, also I'm lazy and hate managing lots of units (I.E apostles). So if you find this strategy helpful and like religion you can probably optimize it even more. Lastly, and this one is important, I use a chop rush strategy to get early settlers out, this will probably get nerfed in the future as it did with civ 4 early on, however I use none of the major exploits like horsemen economy or AI trading tricks, etc.


**Vision**

I think it's best to open where this strategy will take us, I tend to enjoy tall games that end in science victory, I consider ""tall"" in civ 6 to be around 6 cities and that's usually what I end up with. 


**Stage 1: expansion**

First thing I build is a builder (make sure you research mining first thing), I use this builder to chop rush another builder, then chop rush a settler, then another settler, then another builder who chop rushes another settler. Don't be afraid to leave your borders to look for more trees, chopping them will give the same yield regardless of how far away your capital is. Also don't be afraid of barbs, scouts don't capture your units and camps don't seem to spawn armies for the first dozen or so turns, so in the same vein don't be afraid to move unescorted setters, the important part of this phase is to set up an early war economy and you do that by settling early cities. During this time you are using your warrior to scout in a ring around your capital for suitable city locations. you are giving up goody huts and city state contact for an early empire. 

*Note on City placement*

Try to make a ring around your capital, each city between 4 and 6 tiles away. This is SOOOOOO important for later on in the game when taking advantage of industrial/entertainment district AOE bonuses. I find this mechanic to be ingenious, it makes even the worst starts playable because later on you'll be feeding a ton of hammers into your capital. Anyways if you cant settle on a river try settling 1 tile away from a mountain or river so you can get the aqueduct later, I mainly find aqueduct's to be a waste but they are necessary in these cities.


**Stage 2: war economy**

The AI is coming for you, they always DoW early but I think they especially do it when you expand early, in my last 3 games I've ended up facing war from 2 or more sides during my initial expansion and it's going to happen to you. However you can beat any AI if you set up a proper early war economy. this is done very simply by a) settling between 3/5 cities early on. b) running the Agoge, conscription and urban planning civic policies and c) producing nothing but military units. Until you get Oligarchy run Agoge (50% increase production) over conscription as getting the units out is essential, you can coast on your early treasury for a while anyways. To sum it up, what this means is that you are mass producing units with Agoge and urban planning that are free via conscription (remember classical units cost 1gpt to maintain so conscription makes them FREE), and you don't stop producing these units until all threats have been neutralized. even with 4 cities (3 expands + capital) you should be able to churn out a big enough army to survive the rush. let me be clear on this, you do not produce ANYTHING else, the instant that last settler leaves your capital you start making units, usually I start with a slinger in each city then move on to spearmen (obviously unit type will vary civ to civ given certain UU's). Also when i say ""neutralize"" I don't mean wipe out an opposing civ (although razing a city or 2 doesnt hurt) but rather you are safe from any kind of external threat. you'll know when this happens because the AI will sue for peace.


*Note on early war*

I had some major reservations on going all in on early war when i first started playing, and I think that's because every other civ game before this one has taught us that an early investment in war means you dont invest in infrastructure which is detrimental to the late game. But this really is not the case anymore, there are not a lot of buildings worth going after with smaller cities in civ 6 and the early aggressive AI plus barbarians means you NEED to defend yourself. It is also worth noting that an early military IS an investment in the later game now because of the conscription policy card (which you will be running for a long time). In my last 2 games I had 3 units per ciity plus a standing army of 12 units... and it cost me absolutely nothing to maintain, and it didn't really cost me much production because again there is not much to be building in early cities anyways. during the *war economy* stage of the game you are basically building units until your cities grow to a more productive level. This massive standing army will be upgraded later and save us production in our cities, production we can use to rush projects for GP points, gold and science that will help us close out the game.


**Stage 3: The super capital**


The next objective is to start turning our capital into a powerhouse that can support the rest of the empire, we do this very simply by building commercial districts in all our expansion cities (a note here, if you only got 3 cities out during stage 1, or you didnt capture any other cities during stage 2, now is the time to complete your empire and build those next 2 cities, it may be wise to switchout urban planning to the policy that boost settler production by 50%, this is not desirable but necessary). Commercial districts in all our cities mean traders, and you run all these traders out of your capital, this has multiple effects; a) it gives your capital added production, b) it gives your capital added food so you can concentrate on working production tiles and as an added bonus it connects your empire for easy movement of your military. While all your expansions are building commercial districts your capital should be building a small number of builders that will connect any luxuries and develop all the mines you can in your capitals area, once your expansion cities start finishing their districts your capital can start pumping out the traders while your cities play catch up on buildings like granary, watermill and aqueduct if needed, market place after all those basics have been constructed. You will grab those buildings in your capital once all your traders are set (obviously not the market place because you havent built a commercial hub in your capital) but they wont take long to build because your capital will be churning out lots of production. Once your capital has all it's trade routes set you can REALLY start to support your expansion cities, pump out builders and get the essential tiles going in your expansions, to put it simply, you need to get production... hills and mines are priority. Get them up and running. Your capital could also be used at this time to get the Colosseum up and running if lux are looking like a problem, with all the added production from trade and mines it should take only a handful of turns to build an entertainment district and then the wonder. REMEMBER: every city within 6 tiles gets the bonus amenities, so plan accordingly. Lastly, you should have an extra trader kicking around (you are given 1 once you research foreign trade), you should move this guy around your cities developing roads for strategic purposes, connecting your expansion cities to each other.

*A note on tech/civic path*

My objectives with science and culture are fairly straight forward. with science I start with mining and then basically spend my time filling out the ancient techs only, my goal is to stay in ancient era as long as possible in case I need to declare war to get a proper expansion. I dont really care about Eurika moments as science will become a joke later on anyways, that war mongering penalty however can be very detrimental to maintaining early relationships. After that it is very simple:

-Currency (I think thats what it's called? It's the one with commercial districts)


-Apprenticeship (industrial district)

-Industrialization (factory)

-Banking (banks... remember all our cities have commercial districts and we will need to upgrade our army that will cost maintenance, this will help smoothen that transition)

-Gun powder (depends on what unit line I created during stage 2 and if I am near a hostile runaway)

-Electricity (power plant)

-Replaceable parts (farm bonus & infantry)

-Spaceship techs (victory condition!!!)

Civics is even more straight forward... first you go for tier 1 gov, then tier 2 (usually merchant republic in my case), then neighborhoods (urbanization???) then the civic with zoos if amenities are an issue and then on to tier 3 gov (democracy in my case, but I get working class immediately after for the 4+ food per trade route). And that's basically it.


**Stage 4: Industries of the future**

Now we get into the real meat of the game, the AOE district system. Personally this is what makes this game next level, and it's the reason I cant go back to civ 5. I absolutely LOVE the district system and how it pertains to empire planning, now remember how you had all your expansions within 4/6 tiles away from your capital, well this is the reason why. For those who dont know there are 2 districts (Industrial and entertainment) that have certain buildings that, if located within 6 tiles of a city center, give their bonuses to those cities. This means that you can (and will) be feeding the bonuses of 5 factories/power plants into your capital for a massive production increase that turns it into a spaceship producing powerhouse. Because of this the industrial district is valued higher than the entertainment district so always give them priority when determining proximity. I have a very simple philosophy when placing ID's, a) does it reach the capital (and it should given that the capital is in the center of your empire) and b) how many other cities can I hit while hitting the capital, I try for at least 2 others. The last thing I consider when building these factories are the adjacency bonuses, yeah they are good but overlapping AOE is paramount, if you can get a good adjacency bonus then that's great but don't let it guide your placement. lastly you should not be too concerned with the ID placement in your capital, it's main focus is to near a river so you can build Ruhr Valley. On a personal note I just LOVE this system, to me it even makes up for bad starts, knowing you can artificially make up for a lack of good tiles with these production bonuses, I haven't rerolled a game yet in civ 6 and even welcome crappy terrain starts.


*A note on AOE buildings & pinning*
Just so we're clear on the tier 2 and 3 buildings of the industrial and entertainment districts give AOE bonuses. The workshop and arena do not provide AOE bonuses. Also guys, don't forget that pins are there to help you plan all this, that is to say the game comes with a feature where you can place markers over tiles... mark off where you are going to build the industry and entertainment districts so you can plan accordingly, there comes a point before I lay down my industrial district (or entertainment in my capital if I go Colosseum) where I go around to each individual city and start my planning.


**Science, Wonders, Production (and more production)**

In civilization 5 the premium yield was science, this is not so much the case anymore IMO, science will come to us easily in the next stage and later with campus research. The main goal of this strategy is maximizing production, that's why our tech path follows that line, as opposed to civ 5 where you would mainly prioritized science tech/buildings. But it's not just the production techs we need to prioritize, but in every other phase (like our use of domestic trade routes). you need to keep this in mind when developing your tiles, we are only running 6 cities so please keep track of what tiles are being worked, get those mines developed early and later in the game don't be afraid to harvest bonus resources to add another mine or farm (super farm clusters). By the end of my games my empire is essentially a sprawl of mines, farms, and specialist districts with the odd luxury improvement and neighborhood. You're basically feeding your cities so they can work more production tiles. As for wonders I really only prioritize 3 and they range for essential to good.

Essential: Ruhr Valley - +1 production to every mine and quarry plus 30% increase in production, very big bonus in the capital with all the AOE factory/power plant hammers PLUS all your trade routes. It's also worth noting that because we are beelining to industrialization we can almost always beat the AI to it's construction. 

Great: Colosseum - if placed properly can have a very lasting effect on happiness (especially if war wariness becomes a problem or you got a crappy roll on luxuries).  Although not needed in every case, for example in my Aztec game all my lux's were providing 6 amenities and happiness was not a problem. 

Good: Oxford university - not essential (we can make up for science with campus research), and I also find the AI prioritizes it, but it comes after the Ruhr valley so your capital can usually spit it out fairly quickly and it will provide a nice boost to science. (my fastest victory came during a game in which I built Oxford)

*A note on capital tile space*
During this whole strategy you are going to find that tile space for your capital is going to get cramped, this is because you have cities surrounding the capital placing districts inward to maximize the district AOE bonuses. Do not fret, your trade routes coming from your capital will solve a lot of the food problems, however it is wise to ensure you have trio or at least a stretch of tiles for a small farm cluster, preferably around a bonus farm resource. It's not too major but try and take note when planning your expansion city district placements. The food problem basically goes away after you get the 'working class' civic as that gives 4+ food for each trade route which is an additional 20 fpt, however that comes quite late in the game. 


**Stage 5: The Great Leap Forward**

Let's summarize up to this point; you have a capital running 5 traders, another trader connecting the rest of your cities, commercial hubs in all expansions, most with a marketplace for some income, and you're building industrial districts in all your cities. You are also still defended by the 2 dozen or so units you made at the start of the game, not a bad position to be in. The next thing we have to do is, once again, prioritize production, that means you follow up each industrial district with an immediate workshop, maybe you have a city or 2 where you didn't get that marketplace done before ID's were available... wait on them, production is key. At this point your cities should be doing pretty good production wise, it is usually at this point where I get each city to complete a builder to shore up their tiles and then I begin the campus districts. The important thing to note about the campus districts placement is again, not the adjacency bonus, but rather putting it AWAY from the central area to keep real estate free in the middle. Adjacency bonuses are nice, yes, but our main purpose for these districts is the campus research (which we will be running flat out later in the game) so it doesn't matter where you put them. somewhere in between your campus district placements and science buildings factories will become available. Factories are so legit in this game, reminds me of the actual industrial revolution how good they can be. Much like the workshops before them they're construction supersedes all else... stop building campus stuff and build your factories. once completed you will be building your campus stuff in a fraction of the time anyways. It goes one step more with the capital, after you've completed your factory there go IMMEDIATELY into construction of Ruhr Valley. By the time this stage is finished you should have very production heavy cities, a super production capital, and all your cities will have access to Industrial, commercial, and campus research types. (your capital might not have a commercial district at this point but after Ruhr you can complete one in only a handful of turns). Now is the time to keep your eyes on great people, with your production stacked cities you should be able to complete the research projects quickly, and with 6 or so cities doing them you can rush nearly any GP you want.

*A note on mid game defenses*

At this point it might be time to shore up your defenses, this is why we have banking as our first tech after industrialization, and they should be built super quickly after our factories have been completed. In terms of tech and civics you may want to back track to the tech that gives you pikemen (as often you will be running sparemen) and the civic that halfs upgrade cost, you should have already gotten the tech for crossbowmen (I believe machinery?) so nothing to do there. You ought to have enough saved up to handle the upgrade cost for a majority of your units, by building banks at the same time you're doing this you will mitigate the now present maintenance cost.


**Stage 6: Victory**

At this point the game is fairly wide open to you, once you research power plants and get them up and running your capital will be even more powerful. With the ability to use Industrial/campus/commercial research you can rush GP to fit your needs, if you don't want any of the GP's then just keep churning out campus research to inch closer to the science techs needed for a Spaceship win. In terms of districts I like to put encampments in my cities for the production they provide to the trade routes. I tend to balance between them and entertainment districts depending on how my amenities are looking. This whole portion of the game is a balancing act really as you will unlock neighborhoods and you'll need to take time laying them down. So between projects, neighborhoods and entertainment/encampment districts you'll just have to feel out how the game is going. If you've maintained your early military you should have a fairly good sized, upgrade force to defend your borders with. I'm not really sure on the order with which GP appear but you definitely want to keep your eyes out for the ones that increase spaceship production by 100% and the one that adds a flat production bonus for when you get to your final part. I only ever build a spacesport in my capital because it is so productive it can usually spit out the ships before i research the next one required. All the while this is happening my expansion cities are mainly working on various projects.

*A note because I've added a note to every section thus far*

I just want to make a final note here on how important I value production, most cities you have will be capped because of housing so working food heavy tiles often isn't worth it... make sure you look out for a lot of hills, they are the premium tile in this game IMO. So much so that I don't even build acropolises if i play as Greece because they have to be placed on a hill and I hate giving them up. (I don't really build culture districts to begin with but the notion remains). when you get those workers pumping out from your capital after your trade routes are set, make sure you prioritize the mines first, don't forget to check in the city management screen to make sure they are being worked!"

While Covid-19 has a negative impact on many industries and significantly changes the labor market in a bad way, some industries and companies still have a real chance of growth.

There appears to be a link between the occupational risk index attributed to Covid-19 and the development of that profession during the Covid-19 outbreak.

Covid-19 and Industry Growth Factors

Basically, the professions that have opporunities to continue to grow are those that can take advantage of the following factors which are the consequences of policies dealing with Covid-19:

**1.** **Social distance: requires less travel, more at home, more online (upcoming purchase, news, entertainment….)**

**2.** **Closure of activities:** **Closure of**  **schools / public activities / companies**  **(increasing demand for online entertainment activities for children and adults)**

**3.** **Medical equipment for epidemic prevention: Masks, hand sanitizer, antiseptic, drug to enhance immunity.**

# Covid-19 and Industry Risk Index

The score for each occupation is based on evaluating the data on three physical job attributes covered in the occupational database:

1. **Contact With Others:** How much does this job require the worker to be in contact with others in order to perform it?

2. **Physical Proximity:** To what extent does this job require the worker to perform tasks in close physical proximity to others?

3. **Exposure to Disease and Infection**: How often does this job require exposure to hazardous conditions?

With the above calculated risk index, it is clear that the nurses and the medical staff are at high risk than selling online or web developers, programmers (we take this opportunity to thank and be grateful to the doctors, nurses, medical staffs who have been and are actually accepting risks, making lots of effort and sacrifices brings joy and happiness to tens of thousands of Vietnamese people in recent years). It can be said that the higher the occupational risk index (dentists, bar sellers, bus drivers), the more that industry is affected by Covid-19 translation and epidemic coping policies (dentistry, restaurant industry, public transport). There is one exception to this correlation is the health sector: This industry may have a double effects - positive and negative effects which will be discussed below. Let us take a look at some of the main sectors and professions that continue to grow in Covid-19 outbreak to understand this relationship:

**Sectors and fields continue to have development opportunities**

**E-commerce – Supermarket chain:**

Online business giants in Vietnam such as Shoppee, Tiki, Alibaba…. do not depend on the location, hence they are benefiting greatly from the social distancing policy. Specifically, Shopee earned $ 314 million in revenue, up 111% compared to $ 149 million last year (Source: Cafef.vn) and other players also see a great opportunity to tap into online customers recently.

&#x200B;

In Vietnam, in the first 5 months of 2020, 76% of surveyed individuals said they purchased more online than usual, while only 15% of respondents said they would shop online with the same frequency. Only 9% answered that they shop less online (Source: ICTnews.vietnamnet.vn)

The increasing demand for online shopping during Covid-19 also led to the development of delivery services, and professions such as web administration, web programming and applications.

Supermarket chains also thrived, in particular Bach Hoa Xanh, the retail chain of food and consumer goods in The Gioi Di Dong, just announced the completion of the first 6 months of the year revenue which is equal to the revenue of the whole year of 2019 (Source: Forbevietnam.com.vn)

Hence, great opportunities for graduates from information technology, marketing or advertising communications falculties.

**Tech companies:**

The two largest technology companies in Vietnam, VNG and FPT, both have good revenue and profit growth in the first 5 months of 2020.

FPT, the technology sector, accounts for the largest proportion of total corporate’s revenue and pre-tax profit with 55% and 40% respectively. Technology recovery revenue reached 6,160 billion vietnam dong, up 14.1%; profit 805 billion vietnam dong, up 14.8% in the first five months of 2020.

&#x200B;

In the second quarter, VNG (the company that owns the most popular application Zalo and the key shareholder of the Tiki e-commerce platform in Vietnam) achieved 1,546 billion dong of net revenue, up 19% over the same period in 2019. Since COGS only increased 16% therefore, VNG's gross profit margin improved from 46.3% compared to quarter II / 2019 to 47.7% this period (Source VietnamBiz.vn)

In addition, technology and service companies, such as Zoom, have greatly thrived by offering solutions to work from home.

The closure of the schools during Covid-19, trapping students of all grades from preschool to university students at home, also contributed to the increase in demand for online games. Both adults and children have a need to play online games, especially while stuck at home and unable to go out for entertainment and social interactions. According to TomorrowMarketers mobile game revenue in Vietnam market is projected at 91 million USD in 2020 - the number of mobile game players is 33 million people in 2018 and forecasted to reach 40 million people by 2020. However, the actual number of players as of May 2020 is estimated at 55 million already.

The obvious trend of increasing the time spent surfing the web and watching news on the internet proves the above statement in the Covid-19 outbreak over the past few months.

Jobs in these fields are safe and recruitment demand in the technology sector, especially jobs related to technology (web administration, application programming ...) may continue to rise.

You can find out more information for the above personality through the *Financial Times*, “Tech companies still hiring despite mass lay-offs elsewhere” - Or that Amazon is hiring 100,000 employees to meet growing needs in the current period is a testament (Amazon is hiring 100,000 workers).

Employees working in the field of technology (programmers, software designers, web developers, web masters….) may have many job opportunities and great recruitment demand before, during and after the pandemic.

**Other Industries**

In addition to the two sectors and occupations mentioned above, you may find there are many job opportunities in occupations that are less affected and can take advantage of pendamic coping policies in the short and long term.

**1. Finance - Banking:** Service demand has remained or increased slightly - a strong trend of shifting to online services, mobile applications and telephone service provision. FiinPro has just released a 6-month business result report for the bank group. Among the 8 banks that have released business results, it is estimated that 5 banks have hit over 50% of the year plan in term of revenue, including VPBank (58.7%), VIB (55.6%), ACB (52.4%). ) and MB, SHB (about 50%). Besides, some banks also recorded profit before tax growth of over 20% such as VIB (41%), HDBank (39.7%), VietinBank (38.9%), TPBank (30.4%). and VPBank (20.6%). In the group of small banks, profits plummeted such as Bac A Bank, Kien Long Bank.

With background in either of one these major such as finance and banking, business administration, data systems management, systems programming, information technology etc you may have a good chance seeking their jobs in these companies in Vietnam.

2. **Advertising - Communication - Marketing**: Reduced demand for some consumer goods leads to a decrease in advertising in general. However, the demand for online advertising and social media has steadily increased, so some companies in the industry are still recruiting. Fields of study that will help you work in these industries include journalism, English language, sociology, psychology etc…

3. **ICT**: The sector is considered to be the least affected and keep growing impressively in the first five months of 2020 (source : tinnhanhchungkhoan.vn) . To work in this field, you should choose to become a software engineer, information technology engineer, telecommunications engineer, computer science or media engineer. Of course, you can choose to study the socio-economic majors (marketing, business administration) so that you can work in this field if you do not really like to become an engineer.

4\*\*. Healthcare and Medical Sector:\*\* As mentioned above, the Covid-19 pandemic has a double impact on the health sector. Some sectors have been thriving by being able to take advantage of anti-epidemic policies (some specific medical equipment like face masks, protection clothes, medicine... See the chart below). Others medical areas will be negatively affected (reducing the number of people going to medical examination due to Covid-19, the cost of preventing Covid-19 risks increases ...).  The number of enterprises temporarily shutting down increased by 24.2% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 - a similar figure. High (Source: Eveland.vn). But in the long run, the demand for medical services is always increasing

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the outbreak of Covid-19 has significantly changed the business sectors and industries of the world's economies. Some industries and sectors have been severely damaged and need a long time to recover (aviation, tourism, restaurants, hotels, manufacturing ...). Some industries, due to the impact of epidemic countermeasures, still have opportunities to grow as mentioned above, including e-commerce, retail, technology companies, ICT telecommunications, healthcare, online advertising and marketing. . Growth opportunities for companies that are able to move towards using technology that converts to online business development. Recruitment demand for companies in these industries is expected to continue increasing, especially IT related jobs such as programmers, web programmers, application programmers, social network administrators., digital marketing….

## Shark Louis Nguyễn là ai?

Trước đó hẳn không mấy ai biết **Shark Louis Nguyễn là ai**. Nhưng khi tham gia chương trình Shark Tank Việt Nam mùa hai Shark Louis Nguyễn đã được biết tới nhiều hơn.

Đến với Thương vụ Bạc tỷ, ông mong muốn tìm kiếm, hỗ trợ cho những Startup có tầm cỡ, đem sản phẩm của đất nước Việt Nam vươn tầm thế giới.

Tuổi thơ của Shark Nguyễn Thế LữNguyễn Thế Lữ sinh ra tại Việt Nam có cha là người Sài Gòn và mẹ là người Hà Nội. Sau khi ông lên 12 tuổi, cả gia đình đã chuyển sang và định cư tại California, Hoa Kỳ.

Bấy giờ, gia đình ông sống tại thung lũng Silicon với hai bàn tay trắng. Điều này đã khiến cho ông học được tính tự lập từ bé. Lúc 14 tuổi, tức là hai năm sau khi sang đây, ông đã bắt đầu đi làm và tự kiếm tiền. Ông không ngần ngại làm bất cứ việc gì dù là phục vụ nhà hàng, làm vườn, đầu bếp hay dạy trẻ em chơi tennis…

📷Tuổi thơ của Shark Nguyễn Thế Lữ

Mặc dù gia đình khá vất vả cùng với tuổi thơ bươn chải hơn so với những đứa trẻ cùng trang lứa khác, nhưng ông vẫn luôn giữ trong mình khao khát trở thành kỹ sư. Vì thế sau khi học xong trung học tại Mỹ, **Shark Louis Nguyễn** đã thi vào ngành công nghệ với mong muốn trở thành kỹ sư.

Tuy nhiên kết quả học tập lại không như mong đợi khi ông không vượt qua được môn vật lý. Vậy là mơ ước thuở bé của Shark Louis Nguyễn từ đó mà tiêu tan.

Sau đó ông đã chuyển hướng, đăng ký học tài chính tại Đại học San Jose State University. Ông đã tốt nghiệp bằng cử nhân ngành tài chính kế toán tại đây.

## Đời tư kín tiếng, ít ai biết của Shark Louis Nguyễn

Khi nhắc tới Louis Nguyễn, người ta thường nghĩ tới vị CEO lạnh lùng, quyết đoán. Nhưng ít ai biết được thực chất Shark Louis Nguyễn cũng rất tình cảm, gần gũi và là người trách nhiệm trong những mối quan hệ xung quanh.

Shark Louis Nguyễn cho biết mình từng không biết trân trong gia đình, tình thân. Khi bố mẹ qua đời vì bệnh Tim, ông mới nhận ra rằng mình đã dành quá ít thời gian cho gia đình, và không đỡ đần được gì cho cha mẹ. Và còn ông kể lại lúc còn nhỏ luôn sợ bị kỳ thị bởi người da trắng vì sự khác biệt của mình. Cho nên, thời thanh niên ông cũng chỉ tập trung chủ yếu vào việc học, bạn bè, giải trí và tennis.

📷Đời tư kín tiếng, ít ai biết của Shark Louis Nguyễn

Hiện, ông đang sinh sống trong căn biệt thự tại khu Thảo Điền, Quận 2. Ông từng nói, giọng miền Nam gần gũi và dễ nghe hơn. Và ông cũng thích mọi người gọi mình với cái tên là Lứ.

Đã có không ít người cho rằng, đầu tư vào những công ty mới khởi nghiệp sẽ có khá nhiều rủi ro. Nhưng Shark Louis Nguyễn đã cười và nói rằng: “Càng rủi ro lợi nhuận sẽ càng nhiều, ít rủi ro thì có ít lợi nhuận”.

## Các dự án đầu tư của Louis Nguyễn tại Shark Tank Việt Nam

Với hơn 20 năm kinh nghiệm vận hành Quỹ đầu tư SAM, **Louis Nguyễn Shark Tank** đã đặt ra mục tiêu là muốn giúp đỡ các Startup Việt tiềm năng. Đồng thời hỗ trợ cho họ có cơ hội để vươn ngoài thế giới. Xuất hiện trong Thương vụ Bạc tỷ Việt Nam mùa 2, Shark Louis Nguyễn đã đầu tư vào 2 dự án:

Ông chia sẻ khi quyết định đầu tư vào Gạo hữu cơ Hoa Nắng dù Đặng Thị Trường An và Lâm Anh Tú chỉ chiếm 6% cổ phần và 94% cổ phần thuộc về người khác. Nhưng 2 nhà sáng lập vận quyết tâm để bám trụ dự án này.

172,https://www.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/comments/3lbhpe/the_seven_great_religions_of_the_battle_royale/,The Seven Great Religions of the Battle Royale:,2015-09-17 23:28:18,"The following is an analysis of the Seven Great Religions, and what they mean for the holy civs of *Japan, Ethiopia, Ayubids, Israel, Mexico, Tibet* and *Burma* in the Battle Royale MK II. Wall of Text incoming, but there's a tldr; at the bottom, I promise.

**Japanese Shinto**
---

P: **One with Nature** *+4 faith from natural wonders.* Good pick with synergy with Mt. Fuji.

F: **World Church** *+1 culture for every five followers.* @269 follers means +54 culture per turn. Nice

L: **Mosques** *+3 faith, +2 culture, +1 happiness.* One of the better religious buildings. Good pick.

L: **Peace Gardens** *Gardens provide +2 happiness in the city.* Moderate pick, but will help with recovery from over-extension when warring against other shinto-following civs

E: **Just War** *+20% combat strength near enemy cities following the religion.* Decent pick considering shinto's spread. This will work in Japan's favor , good if Japan ever decides to go to war. Oh wait, they just did.

R: **Charitable Missions** *Gold gifts to city-states are increased by 30%.* Japan fucked up Big Time. The whole point of going piety is for one of those sexy reformation beliefs. There are no city states in the game, so this pick is effectively worthless. Japan should haveve taken honor and come out stronger at this point in the game. Instead it's just an *okay* religion. 

**Ethiopian Oriental Orthodoxy**
---

P: **God of War** *Bonus Faith if you win Battle within four tiles of your city.* Nice synergy with Ethiopian Defensive UA

F: **Initiation Rites** *100 gold with each city converting to this religion.* @52 cities = 5200 gold. Not bad.

L: **Pagodas** *+2 happiness, culture, faith.* Best religious building, imho. Good pick

L: **Feed the World** *Shrines and Temples give +1 food.* Moderate pick, but it helps Haile get fat and Tall.

E: **Defender of the Faith** *+20% combat strength near friendly civs.* Absolute Synergy with Ethiopia UA, could not have chosen a better Enhancer belief. Considering all of Ethiopia's picks, they all synergize well with their UA. Oriental Orthodoxy is meant to serve Ethiopia well. Good move, Haile.

**Ayyyubid Islam**
---

P: **Goddess of Festivals** *+2 culture / faith from wine and incense.* I see... no wine or incence in their borders.

F: **Papal Primacy** *+15 influence resting point with city states following islam.* Boo! There are no city states in the game. What a waste of a pick.

L: **Guruship** *+2 production if the city has a specialist*. Great midgame follower belief. Both islamic cities will benefit from this.

**Israeli Judaism**
---

P: **Desert Folklore** *+1 faith from desert tiles.* One of the best pantheon picks for desert-dwelling civs. If only David got his act together and conquered more, he would do better.

F: **Pilgrimage** *+2 faith for every foreign city following this religion.* @54 foreign cities, this means Israel is getting +104 fpt. Nice pick

L: **Cathedrals** *+1 faith, culture, happiness and an art slot.* eh, could've picked a better building. Doesn't hurt though. The art slot will help with housing artifacts- oh wait, archeologists have been disabled in the BR. Darn.

L: **Holy Warriors** *Use faith to purchase pre-industrial land units.* This pick likely saved israel from invasion against the Ayyyubids in part's 8 and 9, but it's not going to help them late game. 

E: **Reliquary** *+50 faith when spending a great person.* Nice pick, but Great People don't win wars. Played smart, this could synergize well with a certain reformation belief...

R: **To the Glory of God** *Use faith to purchase any kind of great person starting in the industrial era.* And Israel picks the correct reformation belief to synergize with reliquary. While TTGOG gets expensive, Israel is making a lot of fpt. If used right it means that Israel can basically buy great people whenever it needs one, which can be crucial for late game maneuvering. While Great People don't win wars, they can be catalysts to victory (and a stronger israel) if used correctly. If only the AI was smart enough to use them properly....

**Mexican Catholicism**
---

P: **Stone Circles** *+2 faith from quarries.* Alright pick. I'm assuming Mexico has enough stone and marble to justify that pantheon.

F: **Church Property** *+2 gold for every city following this religion.* @36 cities, that means Mexico is earning +72 gpt. It's not Tithe, but it's something. Nice.

L: **Religious Center** *Temples provide +2 happiness in cities with 5 followers.* Not a fan of this one: it demands following cities to have at least 5 followers of the religion (not a problem in North America; catholicism is the only religion there) and it requires the cities to have a temple. Only Mexico is going to build temples, so this pick benefits Mexico, and only Mexico.

L: **Swords into Plowshares** *15% faster growth rate for cities if not at war.* This is the Battle Royale. To win, you must wage war. This is a bad pick for Mexico, and it means cities that are otherwise slowing down in growth (getting too tall) will begin to starve when going to war. This pick punishes turtles.

E: **Missionary Zeal** *Missionary Conversion strength +25%.* Alright enhancer belief, and it has some synergy with church property. But Catholicism is the only religion in North America, so it's not facing too much competition. 

R: **Religious Fervor** *Use Faith to purchase Industrial Era land units.* Good pick for late game strategy. Except... Any city (not just mexico's) following catholicism gets this reformation bonus. Considering Mexico just entered the *Medieval Era* and others are finishing up the renaissance (Canada), it means other civs can employ this belief *against* Mexico before she even has a chance to enjoy it's benefits. This may be the worse reformation pick than Japan's choice of charitable missions. I'm calling it now: The North American Blasphemy before turn 220.


**Tibetan Akatt-U**
---

P: **Monument To the gods.** *+15% production on ancient / classical wonders.* Remind me what ancient/classical wonders Tibet picked up?

F: **Tithe** *+1 gold for every four followers of this religion.* @439 followers that +109 gpt. Nice.

L: **Religious Community** *+1 production for every follower in the city (up to 15%).* Great pick that certainly helps with the lack of hammers around Tibet.

L: **Divine Inspiration** *+2 faith for every world wonder.* Good pick for wonder-whores, but how many wonders does Tibet have? (Seriously, what wonders has tibet picked up?)

E: **Religious Unity** *Religion spreads to friendly city-states at double rate.* There are no city-states in the Battle Royale, so this was a waste of a pick.

R: **Jesuit Education** *May buy science buildings with faith.* One of my favorite reformation beliefs. If Tibet can keep turtling, working the mountains and collecting Tithes, they can easily stumble themselves into a tech lead. Tech Advantages win wars, and Tibet has all the tools to find itself on the science leaderboard (it also helps to be small). If my calculations are correct, Tibet should be picking up their free universities right about... now. The only thing Tibet needs to be careful of is their neighbors following Akatt-U get Jesuit Education as well.

**Burmese Buddhism**
---

P: **Sacred Path** *+1 Culture from Jungle Tiles.* Nice Pick for Burma. It makes Early Faith harder to acquire, but it looks like it wasn't a problem for Burma.

F: **Peace Loving** *+1 happiness for every 8 followers in non-enemy foreign civs.* Horrible pick; followers of your religion are presumably your neighbors, and in the Battle Royale, your neighbors *are* your enemies. Considering the high cost for just +1 happiness, there are other better picks. 

L: **Monasteries** *+2 faith & Culture, +1 faith & culture for every wine and incense.* This is a strategic building that only works with nearby wine and incense, or with synergy from Goddess of Festivals (ideally both). While Burma has some wine, it'll nonetheless have to double-down on monastaries if it wants good synergy with it's reformation belief (see below).

L: **Ascetism** *+1 happiness from shrines with three followers.* Nice pick; certainly better than religious center. No complaints.

E: **Holy Order** *Missionaries and inquisitors cost 30% less faith.* Good pick that helps with spreading the religion, but it means less faith to spend on monastaries.

R: **Sacred Sites** *Religious Buildings provide +2 Tourism.* Tourism could be a powerful force very late game (Like, Part 20 late-game) So now's the time for burma to invest. But how powerful is Tourism in the Battle Royale? By the information era, world wars won't be won without it. Let's see if Burma lasts that long.

**TLDR**
---
* Japan should've taken the honor tree or chosen a better reformation belief, but they're still in a good position to conquer East Asia with the help of **Shintoism**.

* Ethiopia's **Oriental Orthodoxy** is Haile's key to victory.

* **Islam** is a joke

* **Judaism** is Israel's key to winning the Battle Royale. That is to say, if Israel is going to win, it needs to get it's ass in gear spawning great people and capitalizing on their ridiculous 100+ faith per turn.

* **Mexican Catholicism** is the only religion in North America. Their Reformation belief grants land units for faith starting in the industrial era. Mexico just entered the medieval era. I'm calling it now: Benito's downfall is a war on all sides employing *Religious Ferver* against Mexico itself before turn 220.

* **Akatt-U** is how Tibet can find itself in a awesome tech lead if they turtle and focus on infrastructure and science buildings. *Jesuit Education* synergized with their mountainous geography and observatories is how Tibet can make a serious tech leap, and give them the advantage they need to be a terrifying late-game presence.

* **Burmese Buddhism** is... alright, I guess.

<
<-- ***QUETZALCOATL*** - THE CHOLOLTECS -->
< Cholula was *the* pilgrimage city of the Aztecs. Thought it would be fun to also make them an economic-religious civ. They definitely would make a great religious CS. The reason ""Quetzalcoatl"" is the leader name is because this is the title high priests went by. I was unable to find any names of the high priests which worked in Cholula, sadly.

**UA: ""Pilgrimage of Cholula""**

*""Earn faith from surplus gold income. Increased trade route yields with cities following your religion. Great merchant points are converted to faith.""*

+1 FPT per 5 surplus GPT. 

+30% science, gold, and religious pressure from trade routes to and from cities following your religion. 

Great merchant points are converted to twice as much in faith.

**UU: ""Pochtecatl""**

*""Pochteca are the Chololtec replacement for both the Great Prophet and Great Merchant--they reward you with gold for converting citizens and faith for trade agreements with city-states. They create a unique improvement that is a combination of the Customs House and Holy Site.""*

Replaces great prophet *and* great merchant. 

Can only be earned through faith.

Doesn't count against Great Engineers or Scientists.

5 gold per era for each citizen converted by this unit. 

20 faith per era obtained when a Pochtecatl makes a trade with a city-state.

Can not both trade and convert people. (Similar to how you can not build a holy site after converting)

Creates a Teocalli, rather than the holy site/merchant site.

*UUI: ""Teocalli""*

+5 gold, +5 faith (total yield). +20% religious pressure when worked. +2 tourism after researching flight.

**UB: ""Tlachihualtepetl"" (Replaces Grand Temple)**

*""Tlachihualtepetl, the largest man-made pyramid in the world, is the Chololtec replacement for the Grand Temple. It provides faith from trade routes and tourism once flight is discovered.""*

+2 faith from each trade route to and from this city. +1 tourism per foreign city following your religion after researching flight.

<
<-- ***TLACAELEL*** - MEXICA EMPIRE / TRIPLE ALLIANCE  -->
< Tlacaelel was an Architect, Moteuczomah's brother, and essentially made the Aztec Empire what it is known for today.

**UA: ""Tribute Empire""**

Can tribute faith, culture, and science from city-states. 

Tributing generates Great General Points. 

+30% tribute strength, -30% influence cost, and -30% tribute decay time with city-states following your religion.

**UU: ""Cuauhtli"" (GREAT GENERAL)**

*UUA:*
Friendly Land Military Units in 1-tile radius have +25% tribute strength and exert religious pressure (+4 each to cities within 5 tiles).

Replacing the citadel, a Cuauhtli creates a Sacrifical Temple.

*UUI: ""Sacrificial Temple""*

Exerts religious pressure.

Sacrificial Temples can be placed in city-state territory, converting some of the CS citizens to your religion and raising your base influence with them.

Can not be pillaged.

**UI: ""Chinampa"" (Requires Civil Service)**

Can work plantation luxuries.

Must be placed on freshwater jungle, freshwater marsh, or lake tiles.

+1 food (+2 food if on marsh)

+1 food for each adjacent chinampa.

+1 production and +2 gold from economics.

Land units can cross chinampas that are on lakes (significant movement and defense penalty, though)

---

<
<-- ***MOTEUCZOMAH I*** - MEXICA EMPIRE / TRIPLE ALLIANCE -->
< Basically an alternative to Tlacaelel.

**UA: ""Tribute Empire""** 

Can tribute and liberate your own puppet cities, at the cost of happiness and gold.

Can tribute faith, culture, and science from puppets and city-states.

-50% of unhappiness and increased policy/tech costs from puppet cities.

*Liberating them leads to anger from their previous owner rather than grace, and it costs you a decent wad to do it.

*Tributing your ""own"" puppet city simply has a timer (during which you can not annex), and costs significant happiness for the duration.

**UU: ""Ocelotl""** (replaces spearman)

*UUA:*

+50% tribute strength. 

+25% combat strength and +1 movement in CS and puppet city territory.

Stays when unit is upgraded

**UI: ""Chinampa""** 

---

<

*Production, faith, food, or culture. You can change it at any time.

**UB: ""Calmecac"" (Replaces Library)**

+1 of your chosen yield (takes the selected UA one) on all improved tiles that yield science or faith in this city.

**UI: ""Chinampa""**

<
<-- ***EISENHOWER***- AMERICA -->

**UA: ""International Highway""**

50% less maintenance on roads and railroads.

+1 faith, culture, and science in cities connected to the capital. 

**UI: ""Highway""**

Requires Combustion.

+2 happiness and +3 production in all cities connected to the capital completely by Highway. 

Civilians have twice as much movement on Highway tiles (stacks with UA).

Each tile costs 6 gpt (3 with UA) in maintenance.

**UI: ""Log Cabin""**

Can be placed on any forest. Functions like a camp when on a luxury or bonus resource.

Requires Trapping.

+1 production and food.

+1 gold if working luxury (+2 with Economics).

+1 production if working strategic.

+1 food from Civil Service."

&#x200B;

anyways i was just wondering how long it might take

through the universal parcel tracking website i can understand that my AP2 is pre-advised to POSTNL / Netherlands, meaning its close to the Netherlands right? (and i live in Denmark) do any of you think it's possible that it might arrive sometime next week? i cant wait for the keyboard and im dying more each day without it.

&#x200B;

i thought maybe some of you have  approxmitaely guess, because the Universal parcel tracking says

Estimated date of arrival at the post office

27 Jun 2019 - 01 Jul 2019, 14 - 18 days remaining

The forecast is not 100% certain, and is based on 14 packages delivered in the last 60 days

&#x200B;

and im sorry if this a stupid post, but i honestly just cant wait for my AP, and if theres any 5Head in here that might have a good guess it would be appreciated a lot or someone that has some experience with banggood deliveries."
176,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/a664mx/should_i_selflearning_or_continue_school_in/,Should I self-learning or continue school in Programming (Coding),2018-12-14 23:08:48,"Hi guys,

&#x200B;

I am a Petroleum Engineer who graduated from The University of Tulsa, OK 1 year ago. Since then, i have come back to my country (Vietnam) to work for a government-related company as an Engineer. However I really do not like it since the salary is quite low (\~400$ per month) and there are not a lot of future in Oil/Gas Industry in Vietnam. The living expense in Vietnam right now is quite expensive (about 3/5 to 4/5 what living expense in OK). I still try to hold down to my job just for surviving. 

&#x200B;

However I have an interested in Programming from early age. My knowledge in the CS field is not very deep, but I would say it is decent since I know how to code in VBA, Python, Java, basic Web Dev (HTML CSS JS NodeJS), I can build PC and Home Server and so on (It is kind of a hobby to me). Most of the knowledge came from self-learning, online course, and a Programming school I am attending now (FPT Aptech).

&#x200B;

The school I am attending right now is quite expensive with my salary (\~1000$ per semester (6 months)). I learnt a lot from their teaching program, mostly because we have teachers who can answer my questions very well. However the teaching program itself is quite large:

&#x200B;

1st semester: C, HTML CSS JS, NodeJS, Angular JS

2nd semester: Java OOP, PHP Lavarel, C#

3rd semester: .Net, Cloud Computing

4th semester: Android Java EE, IOT

&#x200B;

Since I am working and learning at the same time, it is quite time-constraint and expensive to follow this program. Also, when I graduate, I will only receive a High School Diploma Equivalent (HSDE). 

&#x200B;

I am considering since it is plenty of Online Course that can provide me the same knowledge (Coursera, Udemy, Google...) and much cheaper, but I won't have access to teacher that can answer question and make the materials clearer to me. 

&#x200B;

Also, I plan to start World Quant University Online Program for Master Degree (this degree is not accredit outside of Lousiana, and free, but it is free and seem like good knowledge) beside working and study programming. I know that it is very tough and seem unrelated, maybe too bloated, but my ultimate goal is to keep Programming as a hobby/interested (what i really like), and Quantitative Finance as a application field for my Programming (backup). Only my Petroleum Engineer diploma seems to be wasted because it is really hard to survive with Petroleum Engineer salary in Vietnam. Living in Vietnam is very tough because of low salary so i need to be prepared :D.

Perhaps my real question is: Should I abandon my HSDE and pursuit programming by self-learning and online course, or should i keep studying my HSDE and try my best to save money for the course?

Thanks a lot guys!"

***
## *General Information*

**Name:** Jackson King, Battalion, Weatherman

**Nationality:** American

**Weaknesses:** For a while his powers were limited due to a tumor in his head, but it got accidentally shot out by his wife when she had a psychotic breakdown

**Bio:**  Jackson King was the field leader of the first iteration of Stormwatch, an elite unit of superhumans employed by the United Nations to ensure  globally stability from threats beyond the scope of normal militaries.  It was later revealed that his father was Despot, the most powerful telepath on the planet who had been exposed to a radioactive meteor decades earlier (this same meteor gave most of the Stormwatch personnel their powers).  He would go on to be the head and face of all of Stormwatch.  During the events of World's End he would maintain Stormwatch as one of the only  safe havens left.

Some AppStore apps on my phone crash upon launch on my iPhone 7+ ios 10.1.1. They work as normal when in unjailbroken state, but after I enable substrate, some apps crash (and it looks like the crashing apps are random, e.g. some games that rarely opened do not open at all but my most used apps such as Reddit, Whatsapp, Twitter etc. are unaffected). It started to happen from day 1 but it was not much of a problem since it occured with rarely used apps. However, I'd love it if I found a solution to this. Does this happen to anyone else?

[Storm Synopsis](#lhtext) | 
:-:

[**YALO**](#blue-text) is the ninth storm of the [2015-2016 South Pacific cyclone season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_South_Pacific_cyclone_season), the fifth cyclone of the season, and the fifth named storm of the season.



&nbsp;        

[Observation Notes (JTWC)](#lhtext) | 
:-
    
    Tropical Cyclone 14P (Yalo), located approximately 327 nm southwest of Papeete,
    Tahiti, has tracked southeastward at 10 knots over the past six hours.
    
    Animated multispectral satellite imagery depicts shallow convective banding
    wrapping into a circulation center that has become increasingly asymmetric over
    the last six hours. Core convection has been waning with noticeable warming of
    the convective cloud tops, which are obscuring the low-level circulation center
    (LLCC).
    
    As a result, there is low confidence in the initial position. The current
    intensity is assessed at 40 knots, based on Dvorak intensity estimates of T2.5
    andT3.0 (35 and 45 knots, respectively) from multiple fixing agencies.
    
    TC Yalo has weakened substantially since the previous warning, with moderate to
    high (30-35 knots) vertical wind shear (VWS) beginning to decouple the
    system.There are initial indications that the low level circulation center is
    starting to become exposed due to this northwesterly shear.
    
    TC Yalo is forecast to track southeastward through the forecast period as it
    rides along the western boundary of a subtropical ridge positioned to the
    east.Environmental conditions will rapidly deteriorate over the next 12 to 24
    hours as TC Yalo moves over increasingly cooler SSTS and into an area of very
    high (50 to 60 knots) VWS associated with an approaching upper-level longwave
    trough. These effects will lead to dissipation of the system by Tau 24. Maximum
    significant wave height at 260000z is 18 feet.
    
    Next warnings at 261500z.

184,https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/1okiaa/machinist_training_options_in_montreal/,Machinist training options in Montreal?,2013-10-16 19:50:35,"So, I've looked into training options via InforouteFPT. Looks like the only machining/tool & die programs readily accessible are a DEP at Rosemount Tech or a DCS at Dawson (techniques de génie mecanique). However, when I talk to either place about registering as a student, they warn me away. They seem to think I'll be bored or something since I already have an M.Sc, and I've already taught myself to use Solidworks and benchtop CNCs.

Anyway, I want this training. But is there a better way to be going about it? Should I be looking for apprenticeships, or is there a program out there universally acknowledged to be the best? Frankly, both the DEP and DCS seem annoying since I wouldn't be able to work on the side. Anyway, advice would be appreciated."

Before anyone says anything about RAM, I currently have a shitty four year old desktop that I'm replacing, but I can take the DDR3-1333 1x4GB memory from that. Everything else will be trashed. I also have a 23"" 1080p monitor, and I just bought a Monoprice mechanical keyboard and SteelSeries gamepad. I already have a Razer Abyssus, and I can get Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate for free from my university. Thanks for any feedback!"
186,https://www.reddit.com/r/cstheory/comments/2z6xe4/has_anything_interesting_every_come_out_of_a/,Has anything interesting every come out of a claimed proof that P=NP or P ≠ NP?,2015-03-16 09:42:52,"[Has anything interesting every come out of a claimed proof that P=NP or P ≠  NP?](http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2015/03/has-anything-interesting-every-come-out.html)

  
When I was young and foolish and I heard that someone thinks they proven P=NP
or P ≠  NP I would think _Wow- maybe they did!_. Then my adviser, who was on
the FOCS committee, gave me a_ paper that claimed to resolve P vs NP!  _ to
review for FOCS.  It was terrible. I got a became more skeptical.  
  
When I was older and perhaps a byte less foolish I would think the following:  
  
For P=NP proofs: I am sure it does not proof P=NP BUT maybe there are some
nice ideas here that could be used to speed up some known algorithms in
practice, or give some insights, or something. Could still be solid research
(A type of research that Sheldon Cooper has disdain for, but I think is fine).  
  
and  
  
For P ≠  NP proofs: I am sure it does not prove P ≠ NP BUT maybe there are
some nice ideas  here, perhaps a `if BLAH than P ≠  NP', perhaps an nlog^*
lower bound on something in some restricted model'.  
  
Since I've joined this blog I've been emailed some proofs that claim to
resolve P vs NP (I also get some proofs in Ramsey Theory, which probably
saves Graham/Rothchild/Spencer some time since cranks might bother me instead
of them). These proofs fall into some categories:  
  
P ≠  NP because there are all those possibilities to look through (or papers
that are far less coherent than that but that's what it comes down to)  
  
P=NP look at my code!  
  
P=NP here is my (incoherent) approach. For example `first look for two
variables that are quasi-related' What does `quasi-related' mean? They don't
say.  
  
Papers where I can't tell what they are saying. NO they are not saying
independent of ZFC, I wish they were that coherent. Some say that its the
wrong question, a point which could be argued intelligently but not by those
who are writing such papers.  
  
OKAY, so is there ANY value to these papers? Sadly looking over all of the
papers I've gotten on P vs NP (in my mind- I didn't save them --should I
have?) the answer is an empirical NO. Why not? I'll tell you why not by way of
counter-example:  
  
Very early on, before most people know about FPT, I met Mike Fellows at a
conference and he told me about the Graph Minor Theorem and Vertex Cover. It
was fascinating. Did he say `I've solved P vs NP' Of course not. _He knew
better._  
  
Taking Mike Sipers's Grad Theory course back in the 1980's he presented the
recent result: DTIME(n) ≠ NTIME(n). Did Mike Sipser or the authors (Paul,
Pippenger, Szemeredi, Trotter) claim that they had proven P vs NP? Of course
not, _they knew better_  
  
Think of the real advances made in theory. They are made by insiders,
outsiders, people you've heard of, people you hadn't heard of before, but they
were all made my people who... were pretty good and know stuff.  YES, some are
made by people who are  not tainted by conventional thinking, but such people
can still differentiate an informal argument from a proof, and they know that
an alleged proof that resolves P vs NP needs to be checked quite carefully
before bragging about it.  
  
When the result that Monotone circuits have exponential lower bounds for some
problems there was excitement that this may lead to a proof that P ≠ NP,
however, nobody, literally nobody, claimed that these results proved P ≠ NP._
They knew better._  
  
So, roughly speaking, the people who claim they've resolved P vs NP either
have a knowledge gap or can't see their own mistakes or something that makes
their work unlikely to have value. One test for that is to ask if they
retracted the proof once flaws have been exposed.  
  
This is not universally true- I know of two people who claimed to have solved
the problem who are pretty careful normally.  I won't name names since my
story might not be quite right, and because they of them retracted IMMEDIATELY
after seeing the error. (When Lance proofread this post he guessed one of
them,  
so there just aren't that many careful people who claim to have resolved P vs
NP.)  And one of them got an obscure paper into an obscure journal out of
their efforts.  
  
I honestly don't know how careful Deolaikar  is, nor do I know if anything of
interest every came out of his work, or if has retracted it.  If someone
knows, please leave a comment.  
  
I discuss Swart after the next paragraph.  
  
I WELCOME counter-example! If you know of a claim to resolve P vs NP where the
authors paper had something of value, please comment. The term _of value_
means one of two things: there really was some theorem of interest OR there
really were some ideas that were later turned into theorems (or in the case of
P=NP turned into usable algorithms that worked well in practice).  
  
One partial counter-example- Swarts claim that P=NP inspired OTHER papers that
were good: Yannakakis's proof that Swart's approach could not work and some
sequels that made Lance's list of best papers of the 2000's (see [this
post](http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2014/04/favorite-theorems-
extended-formulations.html#comment-form)). I don't quite know how to count
that.
